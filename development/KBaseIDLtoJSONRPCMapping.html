    <h1>KBase IDL to JSON-RPC Mapping</h1>
    <p>In this document we define the mapping between language construts
      in the KBase interface description language to their corresponding
      constructs in the JSON-RPC wire protocol.</p>
    <h2>Service Naming</h2>
    <p>Service names do not appear explicitly in the wire protocol
      mapping. Instead, we assume that the JSON-RPC endpoint for each
      service is well-known via a mechanism outside the scope of this
      document (e.g. the KBase infrastructure project defines common
      well-known names of the form
      http://api.kbase.us/services/&lt;service_name&gt; for each
      service, and the hosting infrastructure arranges for requests to
      those names to be routed to the appropriate service handlers).</p>
    <h2>Modules</h2>
    <p>A service may be composed of multiple modules. The decomposition
      into modules allows the implementor of a service to split the
      implementation between multiple source code bases. For example,
      the Central Store service is composed of two modules, the CDMI-API
      which contains the hand-written API routines and the
      CDMI-EntityAPI which contains the routines that are automatically
      generated from the XML description of the database.</p>
    <h2> Function Invocation</h2>
    <p>A function definition in KIDL maps to a JSON-RPC RPC call. The
      method name in the RPC call is the concatenation of the KIDL
      module name and the KIDL function name.</p>
    <p>The parameters to the function are encoded by position as a JSON
      Array. Each parameter is encoded using the data encoding mechanism
      discussed below.</p>
    <p>The return values from the function are encoded as a JSON Array
      with one element per return value. A void function will return an
      empty Array. A function returning one value will return an Array
      containing one element.</p>
    <h2>Error Returns</h2>
    <p>There are a number of possible causes for error returns from a
      function call. Where possible error returns are noted using the
      JSON-RPC error object response mechanism. These errors include an
      error code, a message string, and optional data. If the error was
      triggered by an exception on the server side as much information
      as possible (stack traces, etc.) will be included in the data
      return.</p>
    <h2>Data Mapping<br>
    </h2>
    <p>The KIDL data types map to JSON as follows.</p>
    <table border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2" width="100%">
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td valign="top">string<br>
          </td>
          <td valign="top">string<br>
          </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td valign="top">int<br>
          </td>
          <td valign="top">number<br>
          </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td valign="top">float / double<br>
          </td>
          <td valign="top">number<br>
          </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td valign="top">struct <br>
          </td>
          <td valign="top">Object. The names of the struct items are the
            names in the Object.<br>
          </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td valign="top">list&lt;&gt;<br>
          </td>
          <td valign="top">Array<br>
          </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td valign="top">tuple&lt;&gt;<br>
          </td>
          <td valign="top">Array<br>
          </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td valign="top">mapping&lt;&gt;<br>
          </td>
          <td valign="top">Object. The keys of the mapping are the names
            in the Object.<br>
          </td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
    <h2>Discussion</h2>
    <p>I am not entirely convinced the separation of module and service
      at the protocol level is a good idea; while it makes sense at the
      implementation level it may be too much detail to expose to the
      protocol. Since namespaces between modules in a service must be
      unique anyway, a service implementation can maintain a mapping on
      its own to direct the request to the appropriate handler.</p>
