<h2>Introduction</h2>
Releasing software is not just packing latest version to tarball and
send to SFTP server. It requires preparation and some planning to be
done properly. Described below is the release procedure for KBase
system builds. The supporting version control system is GIT.<br>
The aims for the release procedure are to:
<ul>
  <li>allow for a testing and validation window before production
release date</li>
  <li>have the possibility for examine released version to test for
reported bugs</li>
  <li>possibility to manage existing releases (hot-fixing critical bugs)</li>
  <li>allow testing a module that is dependent on a second module</li>
</ul>
<h2>Release Process</h2>

<h2>Release Candidate Version Numbers</h2>
In order to avoid renaming of release candidate branches, a sequential
release candidate number is used. The general form takes the following
syntax <b>RC-n</b> where <b>n</b> is a sequentially increaseing
integer starting at 1. This number is referred to as the Release
Candidate (or RC) version number.
<h2>Prepare Release Candidate Branch</h2>
In order to enable testing and validation before releasing as
production, we need to stabilize and test a snapshot of current
development branch. This is accomplished by forking a release candidate
(RC-1, RC-2, etc.) a few days before release of the RC branch to
production. The RC branch is created by the owner of the module
immediately after the <i>developer build</i> is complete. This RC
branch will be used for hot-fixing during and after <i>independent
testing</i> and <i>deployment onto production hardware.</i>
<br>
The module owner or developer creates an RC branch after successful
developer build.<br>
<pre>git ls-remote origin   # this will display all the branches, so you can select the next available RC version number<br>git fetch origin       # just to ensure that your local module has all the same branch references as the remote<br>git branch RC          # See endnote <a href="#1">[i]</a><br>git push origin RC     # origin=<a href="https://git.kbase.us">git.kbase.us</a> or <a href="http://github.com/kbase">github.com/kbase</a>
</pre>
The team performing independent testing and independent build will
start with the RC branch with the highest RC version number. The
easiest way to do this is to start with a fresh clone of the RC branch:
<pre>git ls-remote origin   # to determine highest RC version number<br>git clone -b RC-n kbase@git.kbase.us:modulename    # where n is the highest RC version number<br></pre>
At this point, all changes that result from the independent testing and
independent build are committed to the RC branch. These changes can be
ported to the master branch later.

<a name="1"><b>[i]</b></a> If the creation of the RC branch fails
because one already exists, then you need to move the existing RC
branch in the local and push to the remote (git ls-remote origin; git
fetch origin; git mv RC RC-O1; etc.)
