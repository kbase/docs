NIGHTLY TESTING DIRECTORY

This directory has the same scripts as the t directory but these assume that a 
server is up and running.  These are not used as part of the make test TARGET.  
Due to the time they take, they are better suited to nightly build, deploy, and test.

Test the tutorial functions:
	functional_test.py
