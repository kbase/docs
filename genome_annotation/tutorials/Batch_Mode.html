<h1>Using the RAST tool kit in batch mode</h1>

Welcome to the tutorial on submitting genomes to RAST-tk in batch mode.  
You can follow this tutorial by logging in to the IRIS environment or by working in the Kbase.app command window.
We recommend that you first familiarize yourself with the RAST-tk commands in the tutorials, 
"RAST-tk: Getting Started With The Default Pipeline", and "RAST-tk: The Incremental Commands".
</p>

<p>
We will start by logging in to IRIS or by opening the kbase.app and logging into Kbase
by typing the following command:
</p>

<pre>
kbase-login   username
</pre>
<p>
The username and password are your RAST account username and password.
</p>


</div>
<div>

<p>
After you have logged in to IRIS you will be in your home directory.  
In the Kbase.app, you will be in a bash shell on your computer and should 
navigate to a directory where you are comfortable working. 
</p>

<p>
In order to demonstrate the submission of a batch of genomes we will start by making a new directory.
Type:
</p>
<pre>
mkdir ToSubmit
</pre>


</div>
<div>

<p>
Next we will download the contig files for <i>E. coli</i> and <i>B. subtilis</i> from the Kbase central store into our current working directory.
Type:
</p>

<pre>
echo "kb|g.0" | genomes_to_contigs | contigs_to_sequences  > E_coli.contig   
echo "kb|g.424" |genomes_to_contigs |contigs_to_sequences >B_subtilis.contig
</pre>

<p>
Then we will will convert these to genome typed objects and place them into "ToSubmit". Type:
</p>

<pre>
rast2-create-genome --scientific-name "Escherichia coli K-12" --genetic-code 11 --domain Bacteria --contigs E_coli.contig > ToSubmit/E_coli.gto 

rast2-create-genome --scientific-name "Bacillus subtilis 168" --genetic-code 11 --domain Bacteria --contigs B_subtilis.contig > ToSubmit/B_subtilis.gto 
</pre>


</div>
<div>

<p>
Now we will submit the entire directory, "ToSubmit" to be processed by RAST-tk.  This command uses the RAST-tk default pipeline.
</p>

<pre>
rast-process-genome-batch ToSubmit 
</pre>

<p>
This command returns a job id, which you should save.  
Mine is: 9f0d6d9a-c686-4b55-af6f-e0df59b0bb01
</p>


</div>
<div>


<p>
You can query the status of your job by using the command <b> rast-query-genome-batch </b>.  Try it:
</p>
<pre>
rast-query-genome-batch  your job id
</pre>

<p>
If your job is running you will get a response from the server that looks like this:
</p>

<pre>
kb|g.220035	in-progress	2014-07-29T08:48:36.733-05:00	0001-01-01T00:00:00Z			
kb|g.220034	in-progress	2014-07-29T08:48:36.758-05:00	0001-01-01T00:00:00Z			
</pre>


</div>
<div>


<p>
If your job is completed you will get a response from the server that looks like this:
</p>
<pre>
kb|g.220035	completed	2014-07-29T08:48:36.733-05:00	2014-07-29T08:49:54.069-05:00	http://redwood.mcs.anl.gov:7078/node/751a0a8c-e13b-420d-84de-b2acdb79dd67?download	http://redwood.mcs.anl.gov:7078/node/dc44ef34-3855-42ea-bbb6-0294a5c91a47?download	http://redwood.mcs.anl.gov:7078/node/6e2be0e9-d3c9-4cc7-9eae-c821e30c2e01?download

<p>
We will create a new directory for the output of our RAST-tk job.  Type:
</p>

<pre>
mkdir Output
</pre>

<p>
When your job is completed, you can download it into the directory "Output" by typing:
</p>
<pre>
rast-download-genome-batch  your job id Output
</pre>
<p>
This will download an annotated genome typed object for each genome.


</div>
<div>


<p>
Navigate to the Output directory by typing:
</p>

<pre>
cd Output
</pre>
<p>
if you type,
</p>
<pre>
ls
</pre>
<p>
You will see the contents of the output directory. 
When I do this i see the following files:
</p>
<pre>
kb|g.220034.gto  kb|g.220034.stderr  kb|g.220035.gto  kb|g.220035.stderr
</pre>
<p>
Each file has been given a unique Kbase identifier.  
The ".gto" files are the annotated genome typed objects and the ".stderr" files provide a record of what has been done.   
</p>


</div>
<div>


<p>
You can see which genome each is by typing:
<pre>
grep "scientific_name" genomeid.gto
</pre>
<p>
In my case it is:
</p>
<pre>
grep "scientific_name" kb\|g.220034.gto
</pre>
<p>
Which returns:
</p>
<pre>
"scientific_name" : "Escherichia coli K-12",
</pre>


</div>
<div>


<p>
Finally, we can convert the genome typed objects to the format we desire by using <b>rast2-export-genome</b>. 
I will convert the <i> E. coli</i> genome to a genbank file by typing:
</p>
<pre>
rast2-export-genome genbank < kb\|g.220034.gto > E_coli.gbk
</pre>


</div>
<div>


<p>
That's all there is to it.  Batch mode submission centers around the commands <b>rast-process-genome-batch</b> 
and <b>rast-download-genome-batch</b>.  The most difficult parts are creating the initial directory of genome
typed objects and and the conversion of the downloaded genome typed objects into useful output using "rast2-export-genome".  
When you are annotating a directory with many genomes it may be necessary to write a script that does this pre- and post-processing for you.
