  <p>
   Module KBaseRegPrecise version 1.0
  </p>
  <p>
   This module provides access to a collection of curated transcriptional regulons from the RegPrecise database (http://regprecise.lbl.gov) reconstructed by a comparative genomics approach. It also provides methods for on-the-fly annotation of regulatory interactions in newly submitted bacterial genomes by conservative propagation of curated (reference) regulons.
  </p>
  <p>
   Both curated and propagated regulons are provided as RegulomeModels. RegulomeModel is a collection of all regulons for a given genome reconstructed by a given approach with given parameters. More than one RegulomeModel can exist for a particular genome.
