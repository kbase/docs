   DESCRIPTION
  </h1>
  <p>
   Module KBaseNetworks version 1.0 This module provides access to various types of network-related datasets across all domains of KBase in a unified format.
  </p>
  <p>
   Networks are composed of Nodes and Edges. Nodes represent entities from the datasets (e.g., genes, proteins, biclusters, subystems, etc.), and edges represent relationships (e.g., protein-protein interactions, gene-subsystem membership, etc.). Networks can contain Nodes and Edges from multiple datasets.
  </p>
  <p>
   All methods in this module can be classified into two types: i. getting general information about datasets and network types currently available via KBaseNetworks API For example: allDatasetSources(), allNetworkTypes(), datasetSource2Datasets() ii. building various types of Network objects For example: buildFirstNeighborNetwork(), buildInternalNetwork()
