<h2>Introduction</h2>
This tutorial is intended to teach developers how to use the Protein
Info service to get information on the domains in a protein.

<p>
<h2>Sample Program to look up Domains for a Protein</h2>

<pre>
#!/usr/bin/perl

use strict;
use Data::Dumper;
use Bio::KBase::ProteinInfoService::Client;

my $client=Bio::KBase::ProteinInfoService::Client->new("http://localhost:7057");

my $domains=$client->fids_to_domains(["kb|g.21765.CDS.3010"]);
print Dumper($domains);
</pre>

<p>
The above program assumes that you're running the service locally; if not,
replace "localhost" with the IP address of the machine running the
service.

<p>
This program is supposed to look up domains for the protein encoded
by the fid kb|g.21765.CDS.3010.  This is the tufA (elongation factor
EF-Tu) gene from <i>E. coli</i>, which contains several Pfam domains.
This program should print out a hash, in which the keys are the query fids,
and the values are an array of identifiers of the domains in
the protein encoded by each fid.  Here's sample output:

<pre>
$VAR1 = {
          'kb|g.21765.CDS.3010' => [
                                     'G3DSA:3.40.50.300',
                                     'G3DSA:2.40.30.10',
                                     'PTHR23115:SF31',
                                     'PTHR23115',
                                     'PF00009',
                                     'PF03143',
                                     'PF03144',
                                     'SSF52540',
                                     'SSF50465',
                                     'SSF50447',
                                     'TIGR00485',
                                     'TIGR00231',
                                     'COG50'
                                   ]
        };
</pre>

<p>
In the above example, the protein encoded by "kb|g.21765.CDS.3010" has
two Gene3D domains (those identifiers starting with G3DSA), two
Panther domains (those identifiers starting with PTHR), three
Pfam domains (starting with PF), three Superfamily domains (starting
with SSF), two TIGRFam domains (starting with TIGR) and one COG domain
(starting with COG).
