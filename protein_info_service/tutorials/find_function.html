<h2>Introduction</h2>
This tutorial is intended to teach developers how to use the Protein
Info service to get information on the functional annotations for a protein.

<p>
Currently, the API does not look up proteins by their protein identifier
(i.e., the MD5 sum), but rather by the KBase Feature Identifier (fid)
of the gene that encodes the protein.

<p>
The Protein Info service can return three kinds of functional
annotations for proteins: Enzyme Commission (EC) numbers for enzymes,
Gene Ontology (GO) annotations, and InterPro domains.  The corresponding
function calls are fids_to_ec, fids_to_go, and fids_to_ipr, respectively.

<p>
<h2>Sample Program to look up Functional Annotations for a Protein</h2>

<pre>
#!/usr/bin/perl

use strict;
use Data::Dumper;
use Bio::KBase::ProteinInfoService::Client;

my $client=Bio::KBase::ProteinInfoService::Client->new("http://localhost:7057");

my $annot=$client->fids_to_ec(["kb|g.21765.CDS.3010"]);
warn Dumper($annot);

$annot=$client->fids_to_go(["kb|g.21765.CDS.3010"]);
warn Dumper($annot);

$annot=$client->fids_to_ipr(["kb|g.21765.CDS.3010"]);
warn Dumper($annot);
</pre>

<p>
The above program assumes that you're running the service locally; if not,
replace "localhost" with the IP address of the machine running the
service.

<p>
This program is supposed to look up functional annotations for the
protein encoded by the fid kb|g.21765.CDS.3010.  This is the tufA
(elongation factor EF-Tu) gene from <i>E. coli</i>.  This program
should print out three hashes, in which the keys are the query fids,
and the values are an array of identifiers of annotations of each
particular type.  Here's sample output:

<pre>
$VAR1 = {
          'kb|g.21765.CDS.3010' => [
                                     '3.6.5.3'
                                   ]
        };
$VAR1 = {
          'kb|g.21765.CDS.3010' => [
                                     'GO:0003746',
                                     'GO:0003924',
                                     'GO:0005525',
                                     'GO:0005622',
                                     'GO:0006414',
                                     'GO:0008547'
                                   ]
        };
$VAR1 = {
          'kb|g.21765.CDS.3010' => [
                                     'IPR000795',
                                     'IPR004160',
                                     'IPR004161',
                                     'IPR004541',
                                     'IPR005225',
                                     'IPR009000',
                                     'IPR009001'
                                   ]
        };
</pre>

<p>
In the above example, the protein encoded by "kb|g.21765.CDS.3010" has
one EC number (the first hash), six GO annotations (the 2nd hash),
and seven InterPro domains annotated (the 3rd hash).
