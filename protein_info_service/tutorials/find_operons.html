<h2>Introduction</h2>
This tutorial is intended to teach developers how to use the Protein
Info service to get information on the operon a microbial gene belongs to.

<p>
<h2>Sample Program to look up Operons for a Microbial Gene</h2>

<pre>
#!/usr/bin/perl

use strict;
use Data::Dumper;
use Bio::KBase::ProteinInfoService::Client;

my $client=Bio::KBase::ProteinInfoService::Client->new("http://localhost:7057");

my $operons=$client->fids_to_domains(["kb|g.21765.CDS.3010"]);
print Dumper($operons);
</pre>

<p>
The above program assumes that you're running the service locally; if not,
replace "localhost" with the IP address of the machine running the
service.

<p>
This program is supposed to look up operons for 2 genes, with fids
kb|g.21765.CDS.880 and kb|g.21765.CDS.101.  These are the proA and
proB genes from <i>E. coli</i>, which form a single operon.  The
program should print out a hash, in which the keys are the query fids,
and the values are an array of fids corresponding to the genes in the
operon (currently, these are returned in an arbitrary order, NOT the
order in which the genes are transcribed in the operon).  Here's
sample output:

<pre>
$VAR1 = {
          'kb|g.21765.CDS.880' => [
                                    'kb|g.21765.CDS.880',
                                    'kb|g.21765.CDS.101'
                                  ],
          'kb|g.21765.CDS.101' => [
                                    'kb|g.21765.CDS.880',
                                    'kb|g.21765.CDS.101'
                                  ]
        };
</pre>

<p>
In the above example, both query fids correspond to the same
two-gene operon.
