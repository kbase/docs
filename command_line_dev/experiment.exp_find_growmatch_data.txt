DESCRIPTION
  Given a number of input parameters, returns data for input into
  a growmatch FBA algorithm. Fundamentally the data consists of a mapping
  of an environment, consisting of a list of compounds, and a set of gene
  knockouts to a fitness value or a growth boolean. By default, the data 
  is processed such that data rows (where a row is an environment, set of 
  knockouts, and a fitness value) with identical compounds and knockouts 
  are merged into a single row by taking the maximum of the identical 
  rows.
  
  The return value consists of a mapping of ExperimentalUnitGroup IDs to a
  structure containing several pieces of data about the group: 1) the list 
  of compounds in the environment of the group, 2) some summary statistics
  about the entire group (e.g. including all rows, not just the returned
  merged rows), 3) the ID of the environment of the group, 4) if 
  requested, a list of all fitness values in the group for the purposes of
  thresholding and finally, 5) the list of data rows containing, by 
  default, the knockout list, an empty compound list, and the fitness 
  value (see options below regarding the compound list).

  The fitness value entry can consist of either a continuous fitness value
  (see measurement description IDs kb|measdesc.0 and 1) or a growth
  boolean (see kb|measdesc.5). Groups, in this case, will typically be 
  microarrays or RNAseq experiments. Data that is not associated with any
  group is mapped from an empty string ('') instead of a KBase 
  experimental unit group ID. For this 'group' statistics are not provided
  and the compounds and environment ID are provided on a per row basis 
  rather than once for the entire group. No time series  data is ever 
  returned.
  
  The data is stored in a structure with two fields: 'params' and 'gmdata'. 
  The input parameters are  stored in the first field while the grow match data
  is stored in the second. The object type is 'Growmatch data'.
  
  Inputs: none
  
  Ouputs: none

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -g GENOME, --genome GENOME
                        the KBase ID of the genome to pull data from
                        (required)
  -w WORKSPACE, --workspace WORKSPACE
                        the ID of the workspace in which to store the data
                        (required).
  -o OBJECT_ID, --object-id OBJECT_ID
                        the ID where the data should be stored in the
                        workspace (required)
  --max-knockouts MAXKNOCKOUTS
                        the maximum number of knockouts allowed for any strain
                        in the return data (defaults to no limit)
  --only-wildtype       only strains marked as wildtype will be returned
                        (default false)
  --all-strains         Returns data from all strains, not only strains
                        representing aggregate data, the default behavior.
  --experimentMetaIDs ID [ID ...]
                        the KBase IDs of the experimentMeta entities from
                        which to return data (default all)
  --exclude-groups ID [ID ...]
                        the data related to the ExperimentalUnitGroup KBase
                        IDs in this list will be excluded from the results.
  --only-groups ID [ID ...]
                        only the data related to the ExperimentalUnitGroup
                        KBase IDs in this list will be included in the
                        results. exclude-groups will be ignored. An empty list
                        results in no restrictions (default) except those in
                        excludeGroups.
  --growth-boolean      if true, returns data consisting of a growth boolean
                        (1 for grows, 0 for doesn't grow) rather than fitness
                        values. Defaults to returning fitness values. There is
                        no guarantee that a particular strain/environment
                        combination with growth boolean data has fitness value
                        data as well and vice versa.
  --exclude-medias ID [ID ...]
                        data using the media specified by the KBase media IDs
                        in this list will not be returned.
  --only-medias ID [ID ...]
                        only data using the medias in this list will be
                        returned. If this list is not empty exclude-medias and
                        exclude-compounds are ignored. If all three lists are
                        empty no restrictions are placed on the medias
                        allowed.
  --exclude-compounds ID [ID ...]
                        any data using medias or environments containing these
                        compounds or any of their parent compounds will not be
                        returned.
  --drop-compounds ID [ID ...]
                        these compounds will be silently removed from the data
                        before it is returned. Typically used to remove
                        compounds such as VitB12 which can interfere with FBA
                        results. Does not prevent using medias or environments
                        containing the compound. Only an exact match will be
                        removed from the returned data - children and parent
                        compounds will remain in the data.
  --exclude-solid       exclude any data using solid medias.
  --exclude-undefined   exclude any data using undefined medias.
  --temperature-range LOWER_LIMIT UPPER_LIMIT
                        any data outside the given temperature range in K will
                        be excluded from the results. Defaults to no limits.
  --oxygen-range LOWER_LIMIT UPPER_LIMIT
                        any data outside the given oxygen range (in molar)
                        will be excluded from the results. Defaults to no
                        limits. Recall that -1 signifies the presence of an
                        unknown but substantial quantity of oxygen (as in an
                        unmonitored shake flask, for example).
  --pH-range LOWER_LIMIT UPPER_LIMIT
                        any data outside the given pH range will be excluded
                        from the results. Defaults to no limits. If a range is
                        given, data without pH data will not be returned.
  --agg-method {min,max,none}
                        the method by which to aggregate data rows with
                        identical compound lists and knockouts. The choices
                        are 'max' or 'min', which return the maximum or
                        minimum growth / fitness value, or 'none', which
                        performs no aggregation. The default is max, which is
                        appropriate for nutrient compounds, but less so for
                        inhibitors. Vice versa for min.
  --oxygen-cutoff OXYGENCUTOFF
                        environments with a greater oxygen concentration than
                        this value will have oxygen added to the compound list
                        if it doesn't already exist. Defaults to 0.000002. If
                        the oxygen value is < 0 oxygen is always added to the
                        compound list.
  --all-values          returns a list of all fitness values in each group for
                        the purposes of statistical thresholding. By default
                        an empty list is returned.
  --merge-compounds     rather than returning one list of compounds per group,
                        each row of the data contains the compounds list. In
                        this case the group level list of compounds will be
                        empty. Note that the transfer and storage costs for
                        the data will probably go up significantly if this
                        option is enabled.
  --parent-compounds    by default, the compounds returned are the ultimate
                        subcompounds of the media and environment compound
                        lists. If this parameter is set to True, the compounds
                        returned are not resolved to subcompounds.
  -u USER, --user USER  user ID. You must also provide a password. I will
                        attempt to get authorization from the .authrc file if
                        not included
  -p PASSWORD, --password PASSWORD
                        password. You must also provide a userID. I will
                        attempt to get authorization from the .authrc file if
                        not included
  --url URL             url of the Experiment service, default
                        http://kbase.us/services/experiment
  --timeout TIMEOUT     server timeout in seconds, default 1800
  -v, --verbose         print entire error message
