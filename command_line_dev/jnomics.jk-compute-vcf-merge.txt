The Variation pipelines are run in parallel.
When they complete, many VCF files will be produced that must be merged
This command takes the output from a variation pipeline and metadata from
the alignment operations and produces a merged VCF file.
The output will be a single VCF file in the Cluster's filesystem.
The file can be downloaded with fs -get
