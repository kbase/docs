NAME
     .fba-getcompounds - Get compound information by ID

DESCRIPTION
      This function will get information on one or a list of compounds.
      By default, the list of compounds should be SEED IDs. However,
      KEGG, Name, and other types are accessible by specifying the
      approriate type with --idtype.

      Provided information includes the estimated Gibbs energy of formation,
      charge, formula, and accepted aliases for the compound.

      Use.fba-getaliassets to get a list of valid ID types.

EXAMPLES
      Get information on 'cpd00001' and pretty-print the results
      >.fba-getcompounds -p cpd00001

      Get information on compound 'H2O' (same as cpd00001)
      >.fba-getcompounds -p --idtype name 'H2O'
