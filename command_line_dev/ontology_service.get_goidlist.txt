        DESCRIPTION
	 This function call accepts three parameters: a list of kbase gene-identifiers, a list of ontology domains, and a list of evidence codes. The list of gene identifiers cannot be empty; however the list of ontology domains and the list of evidence codes can be empty. If any of the last two lists is not empty then the gene-id and go-id pairs retrieved from KBase are further filtered by using the desired ontology domains and/or evidence codes supplied as input. So, if you don't want to filter the initial results then it is recommended to provide empty domain and evidence code lists. Finally, this function returns a mapping of kbase gene-id to go-ids along with go-description, ontology domain, and evidence code; note that in the returned table of results, each gene-id is associated with a list of one of more go-ids. Also, if no species is provided as input then by default, Arabidopsis thaliana is used as the input species.
