NAME
      tree-remove-nodes -- remove nodes by label in a tree and simplify the tree

SYNOPSIS
      tree-remove-nodes [OPTIONS] [NEWICK_TREE]

DESCRIPTION
     Given a tree in newick format, remove the nodes with the given names indicated
     in the list, and simplify the tree.  Simplifying a tree involves removing unnamed
     internal nodes that have only one child, and removing unnamed leaf nodes.  During
     the removal process, edge lengths (if they exist) are conserved so that the summed
     end to end distance between any two nodes left in the tree will remain the same.
     If the tree is not provided as an argument and no input file is specified,
     the tree is read in from standard-in.
      
      -r [FILE_NAME], --removal-list [FILE_NAME]
                        specify the file name of the list of nodes to remove; this file should
                        be a one column file where each line contains the name of the node to
                        remove; if multiple nodes have a identical labels, they are all
                        removed
                        
      -s [FILE_NAME], --save-list [FILE_NAME]
                        instead of specifying the set set of nodes to remove, this flag indicates
                        that the list includes the list of nodes to save; if a node label is
                        on this list it is saved, otherwise it is removed
                        
      -z, --merge-zero-distance-leaves
                        after other removal operations have been performed, setting this flags
                        specifies that all leaves with distance zero are merged into a single
                        leaf, and an arbitrary leaf is kept.
                        
      -i [FILE_NAME], --input [FILE_NAME]
                        specify an input file to read the tree from
                        
      -h, --help
                        diplay this help message, ignore all arguments
                        
                        
EXAMPLES
      Replace node names based on the file mapping.txt
      > cat removal_list.txt
      mr_tree
      > tree-remove-nodes -r removal_list.txt '(l1,mr_tree,l3,l4)root;'
      (l1,l3,l4)root;
