Usage: all_entities_Interaction [arguments] > entity.data

    --fields list   Choose a set of fields to return. List is a comma-separated list of strings.
    -a		    Return all available fields.
    --show-fields   List the available fields.

The following fields are available:

    description
        This is a description of this interaction.  If the protein complex has a name, this should be it. 
    directional
        True for directional binary interactions (e.g., those detected by a pulldown experiment), false for non-directional binary interactions and complexes. Bidirectional interactions (e.g., interactions detected by reciprocal pulldown experiments) should be encoded as 2 separate binary interactions. 
    confidence
        Optional numeric estimate of confidence in the interaction. Recommended to use a 0-100 scale. 
    url
        Optional URL for more info about this complex.
