NAME
      tree-html-relabel-leaves -- replace leaf ids with other labels

SYNOPSIS
      tree-html-relabel-leaves [OPTIONS]

DESCRIPTION
      Modify html tree to replace leaf ids with any label. Html tree input is taken as 
      STDIN or as a command line arg. Modified tree is STDOUT.

      -l, --label-file
                        Required. Give the path to the leaf label file. Only one value 
                        per leaf is considered. Data file format is tab-delimited, one 
                        row per leaf with the leaf ID as the first column and the label
                         as the second column.

      -t, --tree-html-file
                        Optional. Give the path to the html tree file, or provide as 
                        STDIN.

      -h, --help
                        display this help message, ignore all arguments
                        
EXAMPLES
      Add the labels file 'leaf_labels.txt' to html tree file 'tree1.html'
      > cat tree1.html | tree-html-relabel-leaves -l leaf_labels.txt > tree1_with_labels.html
      
      Same action as above, but with tree-html-file argument
      > tree-html-relabel-leaves -l leaf_labels.txt -t tree1.html > tree1_with_labels.html
