NAME
     .fba-buildfbamodel - Build a draft FBA model from an annotated genome

DESCRIPTION
      This function builds a draft metabolic model from an annotated genome.
      To do this, it calls the ModelSEED library. To define reaction-role linkages
      it uses either the entire biochemistry in the KBase or (optionally) a template 
      biochemistry defining the functions that are likely to be present in the group 
      of organisms to which the genome belongs (e.g. bacteria and archaea can be given 
      their own templates according to metabolic functions only found in one or the other).

      Note that the model produced by this fucntion most likely will not grow and you 
      will need to run Gapfill on it to perform simulations. See.fba-gapfill for details.

      Description of positional arguments:

      Genome: A Genome object in a workspace

EXAMPLES
      Build a draft model for E. coli, save results to 'kb|g.0.model'
      >.fba-buildfbamodel 'kb|g.0' --model 'kb|g.0.model'
