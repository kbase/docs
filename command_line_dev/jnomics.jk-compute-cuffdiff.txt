Cuffdiff
identify differentially Expressed genes and transcripts .
Organism can be specified with the -ref flag. Input and 
Output must reside on the Cluster's filesystem. 
Optional additonal arguments may be supplied to 
cuffdiff. These options are passed as a string to cuffdiff and should include hyphens(-)
if necessary.
