NAME
    find_prophages

SYNOPSIS
    find_prophages training-set-id < genome > genome.with.prophages

DESCRIPTION
    Use the phispy service to find prophages in a given genome. The genome
    input is a genome typed object as generated by cs_to_genome or
    annotate_genome. The output is a genome typed object with prophage
    features added.

    The training set id notes the closest training set to the genome being
    analyzed. You may use the get_all_training_sets command to enumerate the
    sets. If you don't know which set to use, use set 0 which is the generic
    training set.

COMMAND-LINE OPTIONS
    Usage: find_prophages training-set-id < genome > genome.with.prophages

            training-set-id Numeric training set ID, as defined by L<get_all_training_sets>

            -h or --help displays this page.
