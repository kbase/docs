NAME
      cbd-plotmatrix -- generate a plot of a distance matrix 

SYNOPSIS      
      usage: cbd_filtermatrix [-h] [--type TYPE] sourcePath destPath

DESCRIPTION
      Generate a plot to visualize the relationship between entries in a
      distance matrix.

      The sourcePath positional argument is the path to the source distance
      matrix created by cbd-buildmatrix and saved by cbd-getmatrix.

      The destPath positional argument is the path to the output file
      containing the plot.

      The --type optional argument specifies the type of the plot.  Valid
      types are 'upgma' to generate a tree using the unweighted pair group
      method with arithmetic mean algorithm, or 'nj' to generate a tree using
      the neighbor joining algorithm.

positional arguments:
  sourcePath   path to source distance matrix file
  destPath     path to destination distance matrix file

optional arguments:
  -h, --help   show this help message and exit
  --type TYPE  type of plot to generate

EXAMPLES
      Generate a plot using the upgma algorithm:
      > cbd-plotmatrix mystudy.csv mystudy.txt

      Generate a plot using the nj algorithm:
      > cbd-plotmatrix --type nj mystudy.csv mystudy.txt
