Usage: get_entity_AlignmentRow [arguments] < ids > table.with.fields.added

    -c num          Select the identifier from column num
    -i filename     Use filename rather than stdin for input
    --fields list   Choose a set of fields to return. List is a comma-separated list of strings.
    -a		    Return all available fields.
    --show-fields   List the available fields.

The following fields are available:

    row_number
        1-based ordinal number of this row in the alignment
    row_id
        identifier for this row in the FASTA file for the alignment
    row_description
        description of this row in the FASTA file for the alignment
    n_components
        number of components that make up this alignment row; for a single-sequence alignment this is always "1"
    beg_pos_aln
        the 1-based column index in the alignment where this sequence row begins
    end_pos_aln
        the 1-based column index in the alignment where this sequence row ends
    md5_of_ungapped_sequence
        the MD5 of this row's sequence after gaps have been removed; for DNA and RNA sequences, the [b]U[/b] codes are also normalized to [b]T[/b] before the MD5 is computed
    sequence
        sequence for this alignment row (with indels)
