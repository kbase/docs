	-d          #  Omit pop-up sequence definitions
	-j          #  Omit JavaScript (only valid with -t)
	-l          #  Omit legend
	-n          #  Treat residues as nucleotides

	-t          #  Write html table (Default is write a self-contained page)

EXAMPLES
      Render a tree with species name labels and links to KBase labs feature pages:
      > tree-get-tree 'kb|tree.1000000' -f > my.tree
      > tree-get-leaf-nodes -i my.tree > feature.list
      > cat feature.data | cut -f 1,13 > species.name.map
      > cat features.list | tree-create-url-map -u 'http://140.221.92.12/feature_info/feature.html?id=' > feature.links
      > cat my.tree | tree-to-html -a species.name.map -l feature.links > out.html
