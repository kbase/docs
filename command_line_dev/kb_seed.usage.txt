        Denotes whether this strain is a reference strain; e.g. it is identical to the genome it's related to (True) or not (False). In contrast to wildtype, a referenceStrain is abstract and does not physically exist and is used for data that refers to a genome but not a particular strain. There should only exist one reference strain per genome and all reference strains are wildtype.

    referenceStrain
        Denotes whether this strain is a reference strain; e.g. it is identical to the genome it's related to (True) or not (False). In contrast to wildtype, a referenceStrain is abstract and does not physically exist and is used for data that refers to a genome but not a particular strain. There should only exist one reference strain per genome and all reference strains are wildtype.

    with shell I/O redirection operators.

        Denotes whether this strain is a reference strain; e.g. it is identical to the genome it's related to (True) or not (False). In contrast to wildtype, a referenceStrain is abstract and does not physically exist and is used for data that refers to a genome but not a particular strain. There should only exist one reference strain per genome and all reference strains are wildtype.

    with shell I/O redirection operators.

--is field,value
    Limit the results to entities where the given field has the given value.

--like field,value
    Limit the results to entities where the given field is LIKE (in the sql sense) the given value.

--op operator,field,value
    Limit the results to entities where the given field is related to
    the given value based on the given operator.

    The operators supported are as follows. We provide text based
    alternatives to the comparison operators so that extra quoting is
    not required to keep the command-line shell from confusing them
    with shell I/O redirection operators.
