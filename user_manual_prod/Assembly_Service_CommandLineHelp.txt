Assembly Service

DESCRIPTION
The Assembly Service is a KBase service that allows users allows users to assemble genomes and metagenomes with their choice of several assembly algorithms. The Assmebly Service currently is only availble through the KBase Download. 
This service is at an early phase, and supports the following capabilities:
Velvet assembly: Velvet is a popular de Bruijn graph based assembler for de novo genomic and transcriptome sequence assembly. It was designed for short read sequencing technologies.
Kiki assembly: is a de novo genome and metagenome assembler developed at Argonne. It uses a hybrid of overlap-layout-consensus and greedy extension approaches. Kiki is fast and can work on distributed-memory machines
A5: A5 is an assembly pipeline optimized for de novo assembly of microbial genomes. It is known for generating large scaffolds.
IDBA: IDBA is de Bruijn graph based assembler that iterates from small to large overlaps to reduce the false positive nodes in the assembly graph and improve assembly quality.

COMMANDS
ar_get
ar_login
ar_logout
ar_run
ar_stat

NAME
ar_get -- Will download results. Also retrieves the job status, "-j" sets what job to look up and the number of the Job ID. 

VERSION
1.0

SYNOPSIS
ar_get [-j] [-a] [-s]

DESCRIPTION
INPUTS:      Job ID

OUTPUTS:     The assembly service will download 3 files:

    JOB_ID_assemblies.tar.gz: a compressed archive of assembler data
    JOB_ID_analysis.tar.gz: assembly analysis performed via QUAST

PARAMETERS:
-h, --help     		Display help message to standard out and exit with error code zero; ignore all other command-line arguments. 
-j JOB_ID, --job JOB_ID : specify which job data to get
-a [ASSEMBLERS [ASSEMBLERS ...]], --assemblers [ASSEMBLERS [ASSEMBLERS ...]] : specify which assembly data to get
-s server_addr specify ARAST server address
