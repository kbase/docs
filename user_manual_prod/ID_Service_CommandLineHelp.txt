ID Service

DESCRIPTION
The ID Service provides access to the mappings between KBase identifiers and external identifiers (the original identifiers for data that was migrated from other databases into KBase). 
The ID Service has a number of useful capabiliites:
Given a set of KBase identifiers, look up the associated external identifiers. If no external ID is associated with the KBase id, no entry will be present in the return.
If an external ID has already been registered, the existing registration will be returned instead of a new ID being allocated.
Allocate a set of identifiers. This allows efficient registration of a large number of identifiers (e.g. several thousand features in a genome).
Register the mappings for a set of external identifiers. The KBase identifiers used here were previously allocated using allocate_id_range.


COMMANDS
external_ids_to_kbase_ids
kbase_ids_to_external_ids

NAME
external_ids_to_kbase_ids -- Given a set of external identifiers, look up the associated KBase identifiers. If no KBase ID is associated with the external id, no entry will be present in the return.

VERSION
1.0

SYNOPSIS
external_ids_to_kbase_ids [-c column] DB-name < input > output

DESCRIPTION
INPUTS:      The standard input should be a tab-separated table (i.e., each line is a tab-separated set of fields). Normally, the last field in each line would contain the identifer. If another column contains the identifier use
    -c N
where N is the column (from 1) that contains the identifier.

OUTPUTS:     The standard output is a tab-delimited file. It consists of the input file with extra columns added (database and ids).

PARAMETERS:
-h, --help     		Display help message to standard out and exit with error code zero; ignore all other command-line arguments. 
DB-name		 The name of the external database to look up.
-c Column	 This is used only if the column containing the identifier is not the last column.
-i 		      	 InputFile [ use InputFile, rather than stdin ]
