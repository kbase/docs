Phispy Service

DESCRIPTION
The Phispy Service: is a prophage finder in prokaryotic genome by ranking genomic regions enriched in distinctive phage traits, which leads to the successful prediction of 94% of prophages in 50 complete bacterial genomes with a 6% false-negative rate and a 0.66% false-positive rate. 

The Phispy Service has a number of useful capabilitiies:
View training sets available
Find phage using a weighted phage detection algorithm that was developed based on seven distinctive characteristics of prophages, i.e. protein length, transcription strand directionality, customized AT and GC skew, the abundance of unique phage words, phage insertion points and the similarity of phage proteins.
