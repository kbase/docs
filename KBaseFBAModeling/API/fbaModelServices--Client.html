<p>genome_id in_genome This parameter specifies the ID of the genome for which a model is to be built. This parameter is required.</p>

<p>workspace_id in_workspace This parameter specifies the ID of the workspace containing the specified genome object. This parameter is also required.</p>

<p>fbamodel_id out_model This parameter specifies the ID to which the generated model should be save. This is optional. If unspecified, a new KBase model ID will be checked out for the model.</p>

<p>workspace_id out_workspace This parameter specifies the ID of the workspace where the model should be save. This is optional. If unspecified, this parameter will be set to the value of &quot;in_workspace&quot;.</p>
