OVERVIEW
-----------------------------------------
This KBase service contains all commands that support the reconstruction, optimization, and 
analysis of genome-scale metabolic models.

VERSION: 0.0.4 (Released 2/2/2014)
------------------------------------------
NEW FEATURES:
-Support for custom reactions and compounds in model import/adjustments
-Support for reaction sensitivity analysis
-Switch to the new workspace

UPDATED FEATURES / MAJOR BUG FIXES:
-Major refactor to include object API in KBaseFBAModeling and not in ModelSEED
-Improvements in gapfilling job handling
-Improvements in all object designs to make them faster and more usable

ANTICIPATED FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS:
-Enable import of models from SBML
-Support for PROM constraints
-Support for regulatory modeling
-Support for probabilistic annotation and modeling

VERSION: 0.0.3 (Released 10/10/2013)
------------------------------------------
NEW FEATURES:
-Full support for user generation and curation of template models
-Full support for generation and analysis of microbial community models
-Integration of prototype workspace-enabled genome annotation pipeline
-Plant genome annotation and model reconstruction (proteins and trascripts only)
-Support for comparison of many genomes and models
-Support for iterative gapfilling
-More API functions for querying model data

UPDATED FEATURES / MAJOR BUG FIXES:
-Model reconstruction can now be done from a template
-Fixed bugs in job generation and gapfilling
-Improvements in flux balance analysis
-Improvements in model retrieval scripts

ANTICIPATED FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS:
-More commands to support model reconciliation
-Commands to view model history
-Enable import of models from SBML
-Support for PROM constraints
-Support for regulatory modeling
-Support for probabilistic annotation and modeling

VERSION: 0.0.2 (Released 11/30/2012)
------------------------------------------
NEW FEATURES:
-This is the first public release of the KBaseFBAModeling Services.
-adjusted functions to accept arguments as a hash instead of an array
-added ability to provide authentication token in input arguments
-switched function to operate against the workspaces rather than receiving typed objects directly
-set functions to utilize queuing and the cluster so no command runs longer than 60 seconds
-added reconciliation commands
-added accessors to retrieve model data for viewing in websites: GLAMM and ModelViewer

UPDATED FEATURES / MAJOR BUG FIXES:
-none.

ANTICIPATED FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS:
-more commands to support model reconciliation
-commands to view model history
-enable import of models from SBML
-support for PROM constraints

VERSION: 0.0.1 (Released 8/4/2012)
------------------------------------------
NEW FEATURES:
-This is the first internal release of the KBaseFBAModeling Service, all methods are new.

UPDATED FEATURES / MAJOR BUG FIXES:
-none.

ANTICIPATED FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS:
-public release of the service
