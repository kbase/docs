<p>Compression Based Distance (CBD) service</p>

<p>Compression-based distance (CBD) is a simple, rapid, and accurate method to efficiently assess differences in microbiota samples. CBD characterizes the similarities between microbial communities via the amount of repetition or overlap in order to determine microbial community distance. CBD relies on the fact that more repetitive data is the more it can be compressed. By combining 16S rRNA hypervariable tag data from different samples and assessing the relative amounts of compression, there is a proxy for the similarities between the communities. The amount of compression is converted to a distance by taking compression gained by combining the datasets over the total compressed size of the individual datasets. The distance has a value with a minimum of 0 meaning the communities are the same and a maximum of 1 meaning the communities are completely different.</p>

$input is a BuildMatrixParams
$job_id is a string
BuildMatrixParams is a reference to a hash where the following keys are defined:
	node_ids has a value which is a reference to a list where each element is a string
	format has a value which is a string
	scale has a value which is a string</pre>

<p>Build a distance matrix from a set of sequence files for microbiota comparisons. Compression based distance uses the relative compression of combined and individual datasets to quantify overlaps between microbial communities. Returns the job identifier of the job submitted to build the distance matrix.</p>
