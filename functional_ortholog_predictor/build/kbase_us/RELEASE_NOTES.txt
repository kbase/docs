OVERVIEW
------------------------------------------
This module provides public interface/APIs for KBase functional ortholog predictor. The function is first demonstrated by Mutwil et al., 2011, Plant Cell. 
Given a well studied gene in organism_A and several ortholog in organism_B, this module can predict the best functional ortholog based on gene co-expression network.
For example, Arabidopsis gene FT is a well studied gene, it has two ortholog in Poplar based on sequence analysis. These two ortholog are a result of genome duplication after the seperation of these two organisms. So, we can not tell which one performs the function of Arabidopsis gene FT. By comparing their co-expression network, we can predict which one has a better chance to perform the function of FT.
