OVERVIEW
-----------------------------------------
The invocation service allows access to command line scripts running on KBase hardware.

It also deploys the Iris interface, which provides a web gui to do the the same.

VERSION: 0.0.6 (Release 12/13/2013)
------------------------------------------
- Resolved the issue regarding downloads occasionally not working.
- Resolved the layout issue that would occasionally make the chevrons on the command list slide off the screen.
- Fixed redirecting STDERR, as well as appending to files.

VERSION: 0.0.5 (Release 11/18/2013)
------------------------------------------
- Scriptability - save your commands to a file (one command per line), then run it later with execute nameofscript
- Scriptability - Write a javascript program and run it later with evaluate text of program or evaluate name of program file. The terminal object is accessible via $terminal, the current widget via $widget. Run further iris commands via $terminal.invoke('....');
- Multiple commands can be run at once - delimited commands with semicolons. echo a ; echo b
- ls command can now accept standard shell wildcard syntax ls *.txt, or ls sequences.*, etc.
- Added variables command to list user defined session variables
- Added download filename command to download a file from the command line
- Added edit filename command to launch the file editor from the command line
- Added environment and setenv key=value syntax to customize Iris behavior
- Added end command to jump to end of terminal input
- Added record command. Save all your actions from that point on as an executable script. Save it with save nameofscript. It can then be executed with execute nameofscript
- Added new file button () to file browser to add and optionally immediately edit a file
- Added automatic communication with the workspace. Pass around "files" with @W#workpaceid:type:objectid-instance, such as: all_entities_Genome > @W#genome_obj_in_workspace, will create an object with id 'genome_obj_in_workspace in your current workspace. The workspace id, type, and instance number are optional (and must be : delimited, the instance is appended with a hyphen). If this is an ID through standard script redirects (< or >), you don't need to specify IO. If it's a switch (some_script -i name_of_file) then append the io flag - @W#objid#i to read from the workspace or @W#objid#o to write to it.
- Much nicer selection of variables with the right arrow key
- Alphabetically sorted the groups of commands
- Scrolling up while the UI is automatically scrolling down will now halt the scroll
- Greatly improved performance of 'view' command
- Moved the interface to bootstrap v3.0
