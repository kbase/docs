<H1>Tutorial: Building a new genome scale metabolic model reconstruction</H1>
<H2>Introduction</H2>
This tutorial will teach you how to build a genome scale metabolic model reconstruction starting from an annotated genome object using the DOE Systems Biology Knowledgebase tools.
<P><B>Prerequisites:</B> Genome Annotation Tutorial, Workspaces Tutorial</P>
<H2>Building a whole genome metabolic model</H2>
<H3>Getting the genome typed object into the workspace</H3>
The command <i>genome_to_workspace</i> can be used to 
<H3>Genome typed object to FBA Model</H3>
run genome_to_fba using genomeTO in workspace, return model into workspace
<H3>Verify model creation</H3>
run workspace command to list objects in workspace, view model object metadata
<H3>View model</H3>
print to html, sbml, export for COBRA? other tools?; view in browser; info on what the model metadata fields; 
<H3>View model attributes</H3>
details on model fields (compounds, compartments, biomass, reactions, gapfilling?)
<H2>FBA</H2>
Flux balance analysis tools in the runfba command
<H3>runfba usage</H3>
getting usage/help/man pages/etc; conventions used by the program
<H3>finding models in your workspace</H3>
list command for models (already covered above, but whatever we can repeat it); check metadata to see if it's been gapfilled already
<H3>running runfba</H3>
actual command for creating fba output; discussion on some options/defaults; minimum you need to know; media discussion? link to media tutorial?
<H3>View model</H3>
same as above mostly; explaination of new metadata fields; viewing new attributes of the model; link to gapfilling tutorial if model didn't grow
<H3>Exploring fluxes</H3>
a little discussion; biomass; excreted compounds; input compounds consumed;
<H3>runfba on different media</H3>
link to media tutorial; running fba on different media, i.e. exploring carbon sources
<H3>runfba on gene or reaction knockouts</H3>
specifiying ko genes --geneko or reactions --rxnko and running runfba
<H3>changing the objective funcion</H3>
this is more complicated; assume the user mostly knows what they're doing and understands most of the terms; maybe an "Aside" box with more details
