<h2>Constructing the model</h2>

<h3>1. Lookup genome id</h3>
<p> 
The first step is to select the genome that you wish to analyze and construct the 
regulatory model. The genome must be preloaded into the KBase infrastucture. Use 
the KBase command <i>all_entities_nome</i> to list the genomes that are avalable,
using grep (or other commands) to narrow down the search.
</p>

<pre>
  all_entities_Genome -f scientific_name | grep -i 'Shewanella sp MR-4'
  kb|g.19865	Shewanella sp MR-4
</pre>

<p>
For this tutorial we will use the genome id 'kb|g.19865'
</p>

<h2>2. Display the availale model collections</h2>
<p>
To construct a model for a new genome, you must select the regulatory model collection 
you wish to use as a reference. This is a manual process based on taxonic distance
and collection quality. To get started, so you can lookup all of the available model 
collections, iterate through them, and print the collection names and their properties.
</p>

<pre>
  ## Get all the regulome model collections
  getRegulomeModelCollections

  ## Iterate through the collection
  ##   print the collection name and properties
</pre>



<h3>3. Select the model collection for your genome</h3>
<p>
Examine the list of model collections and find the collection that is most closely 
related to your genome. You should also consider the quality of the model by looking 
at the number of regulons and regulated genes in each model. Model collections
with more regulons will generally work better.
</p>


<h3>4. Build the regulome model</h3>
<p>
Now that you have selected your genome id and your regulon collection id, you
can build the regulatory model for the genome by projecting the regulon model
from the selected collection to the new genome. This process will typically take
5 to 10 minutes to complete, so the build command will just return a process id
as the job is launched. You should then periodically check on the status of that
process every 10 or 15s until it finishes.
</p>

<pre>
  processState = buildRegulomeModel

  while (processState->!done)
  do
    sleep(15s)
  done
</pre>


<h3>5. Examine the regulome model</h3>
<p>
After the regulome model has been constructed on the new genome, you can inspect it
or compare it to other models. Biologically, the regulon that regulates the largest
number of genes is the global regulon for the species. This can be easily discovered
by computing some basic summary statistics on the new model
</p>

<pre>
  list<RegulonModelStat> stats = getRegulonModelStats(regulomeModelId)

  $global_regulon_id = undef;
  $global_regulon_cnt = 0;

  Iterate through the stats
    Print the regulonModelId, regulatedOperonCount, regulatedGeneCount
    if (regulatedGeneCount > global_regulon_cnt)
       $global_regulon_id  = regulonModelId
       $global_regulon_cnt = regulatedGeneCount
       

  print "The master regulon is $global_regulon_id and it regulates $global_regulon_cnt genes"

</pre>
