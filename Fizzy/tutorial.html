<h1> Fizzy (feature selection) service</h1>

<p>

This tutorial gives an example how to invoke the Fizzy service to determine the most significant features within a metagenomic abundance matrix. 

</p>
<code>
#!/usr/bin/perl 
# Illustrate the basic functionality of the Fizzy API

# import some standard packages
use warnings;
use strict;
use Data::Dumper;
</code>
<p>
# Here we are going to define what the IDs are that we would 
# like to obtain from KBase and specify the source used to 
# generate the abundance data. Keep tabs on the matrix service
# on KBase to see what sources can be specified. 
</p>

<code>
my $ids = ["4447970.3","4447971.3","4447101.3","4447102.3","4447103.3","4447192.3","4447903.3","4447943.3","4445990.3","4445994.3","4445993.3","4445996.3","4476877.3"];
my $source = "KEGG"; 
</code>


<code>
use FizzyClient;
my $FizzyService = FizzyClient->new("http://localhost:7047");
my $feature_data_1 = $FizzyService->feature_selection($ids, $source);
print Dumper($feature_data_1)
</code>
