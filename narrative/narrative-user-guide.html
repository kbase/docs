<h1>Narrative Interface Quick Start Guide</h1>
<div class="rounded-box" style="width: 25%; float: right; margin: 1em 1em 1em 1em;">
<h2>Before Beginning</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="/get-started/sign-up"><strong>Sign up for a KBase account</strong></a>, if you haven’t already.</li>
<li>We recommend accessing the Narrative Interface and other KBase interfaces with the latest version of either <strong>Mozilla Firefox</strong> or <strong>Google Chrome</strong> browsers. Please see the <a href="/user-support/documentation/supported-browsers">Supported Browsers</a> page for more information.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p><span>The Narrative Interface is a new graphical user interface that enables researchers to create interactive, reproducible records of the data, computational steps, and thought processes underpinning their results. These records can be shared as “active papers” called Narratives that let others repeat the computational experiment, even altering parameters or input data to achieve different or improved results. Intrinsically reproducible, Narratives serve as a new type of publication by (1) explicitly capturing the parameters associated with various algorithms, (2) clearly showing how users applied the algorithms to selected datasets, (3) recording the provenance and metadata for all data used in the analyses; and (4) transparently documenting the process by which results were used to derive biological insight and conclusions.
</span></p>
<p>The Narrative Interface is still in active development, and new capabilities and features are constantly being added. This guide will help you get started by showing you how to:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/get-started/narrative-quick-start/#login">Log in to the Narrative Interface</a></li>
<li><a href="/get-started/narrative-quick-start/#viewnarrative">View an existing Narrative</a></li>
<li><a href="/get-started/narrative-quick-start/#copynarrative">Copy a Narrative</a></li>
<li><a href="/get-started/narrative-quick-start/#create">Create a new Narrative</a></li>
<li><a href="/get-started/narrative-quick-start/#addcontent">Add content to your Narrative</a></li>
<li><a href="/get-started/narrative-quick-start/#apps">Start analyzing your data quickly with Narrative Apps</a> (coming soon)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="login">Log in to the Narrative Interface</h2>
<p>Go to the Narrative Interface home page at <a href="http://narrative.kbase.us/" target="_blank">narrative.kbase.us</a>. At the top, you will see these key features:</p>
<div class="screengrab"><img src="/files/8714/0743/2074/narrativeQS27.png" alt="narrativeQS27.png" width="750" /></div>
<ul>
<li><strong>KBase logo</strong> — Links to the KBase home page (kbase.us).</li>
<li><strong>Narratives</strong> — From the “Narratives” menu, you can create a new Narrative and access your existing Narratives, as well as others that have been shared with you by collaborators or made publicly available.</li>
<li><strong>Workspaces</strong> — In KBase, workspaces let you store, analyze, and share your private data objects. The “Workspaces” menu links to Workspace Browser, where you can create and manage workspaces and view interactive information about the data objects stored in them.</li>
<li><strong>Search Data</strong> — The new search interface, which is rapidly developing, allows you to search some of the public data stored in KBase. More data types will be added to the search interface soon.</li>
<li><strong>Upload</strong> — Once developed, this tool will let you upload data files from your computer to your workspace so that you can analyze the data in your Narratives.</li>
<li><strong>Help</strong> — Links to documentation and contact information for submitting questions and help requests.</li>
</ul>
p>Using either the link at the top right or the box in the center of the page, sign into KBase with your username and password.</p>
<h2 id="viewnarrative">View an Existing Narrative</h2>
<p>KBase is currently undergoing a major update. We are developing a set of Narrative "apps" that will make it easy to upload and analyze your data with KBase's powerful analysis tools. In the meantime, you can explore public Narratives and Narratives that have been shared with you via the tabs to the left side of the Narrative page. (You will need to sign in to see the “My Narratives" and "Shared With Me" tabs.) Note that some of the public Narratives are not working at the moment due to changes in the underlying software.</p>
<p>You can try clicking on one of the public Narratives to open a read-only version of the Narrative that has already been populated with a summary, input datasets, and output from KBase services that have been run on the input data. The screenshot below shows part of a Comparative Genomics Narrative.</p>
<div class="screengrab"><img src="/files/4514/0735/3171/narrativeQS2.png" alt="narrativeQS2.png" width="750" height="527" /></div>

<p>When you open a Narrative, there are several key features:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>The "Data" panel in the upper left for viewing all data files in your Narrative</li>
<li>The "Services" panel in the lower left for selecting different KBase services that you can use to analyze your data</li>
<li>The main center panel for viewing or composing a Narrative</li>
<li>A URL that is unique for every Narrative, allowing you to easily share your Narrative with collaborators or even the scientific community at large</li>
</ol>
<div class="rounded-box" style="width: 40%; float: right; margin: 1em 1em 1em 1em;">
<h3>Why is the Narrative complaining about websockets?</h3>
<p>The KBase Narrative Interface is built on top of the iPython Notebook, which uses a protocol called "websockets" for communicating between the browser and the server. The websocket protocol is similar to, but not the same as, the HTTP protocol used for the Web. Thus, some firewalls and Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) that work fine for web browsing can still block or interfere with websockets, causing the Narrative to fail.</p>
<p>If you are trying to use the Narrative Interface and see error messages about websockets, you have two options: (a) stop using the VPN or firewall that is causing it to fail or (b) change the VPN or firewall to properly handle the websocket protocol. Option (b) will probably involve talking to your local network administrators.</p>
<p>One other thing to check is that the URL you are visiting starts with https://. If it starts with http://, try changing it to https://.</p>
<p>Another reason you might see a websocket error is in a Narrative window that you've left open for a while and your session has expired. If reloading the page doesn't work, you may have to log out and log in again.</p>
<p>If you are not sure whether the errors you are seeing are due to websockets, you can test the websocket protocol on your connection to the Internet using the public server at <a href="http://www.websocket.org/echo.html" target="_blank">http://www.websocket.org/echo.html</a>.</p>
</div>
<h3>The Data Panel</h3>
<div class="screengrab" style="float: right;"><img src="/files/6714/0735/3172/narrativeQS3.png" alt="narrativeQS3.png" width="300" height="419" /></div>
<p> </p>
<p>By default, the data panel's "My Workspace Data" tab is selected when you open a Narrative (see image). This displays all the data objects contained in the current workspace. Because workspaces can contain multiple Narratives, this tab will show the datasets used not only in the Narrative you are viewing, but also in all other Narratives within the workspace. To see only the datasets used in the current Narrative, click on the "Narrative" tab. (Note that the data panel may take a while to load when you first open a Narrative.)</p>
<p>Several options are available for finding and displaying data objects in the data panel. A drop-down menu will let you sort data by type. By default, all types are shown when you open your Narrative.</p>
<p>You can also list data objects by ID in alphabetical or reverse alphabetical order by clicking the ID button in the middle of the panel.</p>
<p>A search box lets you search for a data object of interest within the data panel. For example, click on the "My Workspace Data" tab and type “model” in the search box to display a list of models that were generated in the Narratives contained in the current workspace. Your search will return a list of several data objects:</p>
<ul>
<li>CACIA_14H1_model_translated_gf.fba.0</li>
<li>CACIA_14H1_model_translated.fba.0</li>
<li>CACIA_14H1_model_translated</li>
<li>CACIA_14H1_model_translated_gf</li>
<li>CACIA_model_kbase</li>
</ul>
<p>Like all data objects in the panel, you can hover over the names of these models to see a short description of the type of object they are. For more information, click on the question mark to the right of a data object. This will open a window listing the data object’s properties. Below is the properties window for CACIA_model_kbase.</p>
<p> </p>
<div class="screengrab"><img src="/files/9714/0735/3173/narrativeQS4.png" alt="narrativeQS4.png" width="450" height="474" /></div>
<p>Among the information in this window is a drop-down menu at the bottom that shows the object’s version history. Also at the bottom are two buttons that link to further details.</p>
<p>The “Object Type Details” button opens a window that displays information on data versioning and the type of data you are viewing.</p>
<p>The “View Landing Page” button opens a new browser window showing a Landing Page with more information about the object. The information shown will depend on the type of object you have selected. Although not all data objects in KBase have Landing Pages yet, the number that do is increasing. The panels on Landing Pages are moveable so you can customize the layout of the page. In this example, the selected object is a flux balance analysis (fba) model, so the Landing Page provides overview information on the model, as well as other model details such as reactions and compounds. (Note that information on some Landing Pages may take a few minutes to load.) More details on Landing Pages are provided in the <a href="/get-started/data-search-quick-start/">Data Search Quick Start</a>.</p>
<div class="screengrab"><img src="/files/4814/0735/3175/narrativeQS5.png" alt="narrativeQS5.png" width="750" height="387" /></div>
<p>Return to the browser window displaying the Narrative and close the data object properties window. As you look through the Narrative, you can follow the analyses that were run by the creator of the Narrative, as well as read commentary about why these analyses were run and what the results imply.</p>

<h2 id="copynarrative">Copy a Narrative</h2>
<p>If you want to try running the steps in a Narrative and possibly even changing them, you will first need to make a copy of it. You can copy any Narrative for which you have read permission. Once you copy a Narrative and its associated data into your own workspace, you can run all of its analyses, alter parameters or datasets if you choose, and save your changes to your copy.</p>

<p>To browse public Narratives, click the "Public" link on the left of the "Narratives" page. You can copy these Narratives and their associated data by copying the workspace in which they are stored.
Search for the Narrative called "Phenotype and Regulation Modeling" among the public narratives and notice the gear button next to its workspace (see image).</p>
<p><img src="/files/3614/1140/5207/narrativesQScopyPublic.png" alt="narrativesQScopyPublic.png" width="750" height="147" /></p>
<p>Click on the gear to open the "Manage Workspace" window that allows you to copy the workspace using the "Copy" button at the bottom.</p>
<p><img src="/files/cache/5530c91746e88edebf8840af319d051f.png" alt="narrativesQScopyManage.png" width="400" height="347" /></p>
<p>Once again this opens the "Copy Workspace" window described in the section above. This window allows you to create a new workspace to copy your items to and set permissions. Once you have clicked the "Copy" button in this window, click on the "My Narratives" link on the left. You should see the Phenotype and Regulation Modeling Narrative among your Narratives listed on this page (see image below).</p>
<p><img src="/files/4714/1140/5203/narrativesQScopyMy2.png" alt="narrativesQScopyMy2.png" width="750" height="230" /></p>
<p>Now that you have a copy of the Comparative Genomics and Phenotype and Regulation Modeling Narratives, you can try running their steps or continue to the next section to learn how to recreate the steps in your own new Narrative. Rebuilding the steps in a new Narrative will allow you to and familiarize yourself with many aspects of the Narrative Interface.</p>

<h2 id="create">Create a New Narrative</h2>
<p>To create your own new Narrative, click the “+New Narrative” button at the top of the "Narratives" page.</p>
<div class="screengrab"><img src="/files/cache/9c84ae5b9e6cbcb3476b65de0c8c4105.png" alt="qs1MM.png" width="300" /></div>
<p>Clicking on this button will open the “Create New Narrative” window (see image). Choose the workspace for your new Narrative by selecting one of your existing workspaces from the drop-down menu. You can also click the blue “New WS” link to create a new workspace for your Narrative. For this example, we chose one of the copied workspaces that we created earlier in this tutorial (named "Featured_narratives_workspace").</p>
<div class="screengrab"><img src="/files/cache/f459e84dd45042567cf67028652e56a5.png" alt="narrativesQScreate.png" width="400" height="259" /></div>
<p>Once you have designated a workspace for your Narrative, enter a name for it. Here, we chose “My_new_narrative.” Add an optional description if you wish and then click the blue “Create” button.</p>
<p>Refresh your browser to see your new Narrative listed at the top of the My Narratives page (see image).</p>
<div class="screengrab"><img src="/files/6314/1140/5226/narrativesQSname.png" alt="narrativesQSname.png" width="750" height="190" /></div>
<p>This page has several options for displaying and managing your Narratives:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>This drop-down lets you customize the columns of information displayed in your list of Narratives. By default, Narrative, Workspace, Last Modified, Modified by, and Shared With are displayed. Additional options include Timestamp, Size, Byte Size, and Module.</li>
<li>The trash icon, along with the button to its right, appears when you select a Narrative from the list. Clicking the trash button will delete your selected Narrative. <strong>An undelete option is coming soon, so be aware that Narrative deletions are currently permanent and immediate (i.e., you will not get a message asking you to confirm deletion).</strong></li>
<li>The edit button allows you to rename a selected Narrative.</li>
<li>A search box lets you search for and quickly find a specific Narrative,which can be useful if your Narratives list is long.</li>
<li>Each Narrative is followed by a version number. Click on the number to see the history of the Narrative and to revert to a previous version if you wish.</li>
<li>Hover over a Narrative name to display a blue “More” link to the right. Clicking “More” will open a window that displays information about the Narrative data object including size, type, ID, owner, modified date, and more.</li>
<li>The gear icon will open the “Manage Workspace” window. In addition to copying a workspace, this window provides options for sharing. Click the "Edit" button in the upper right corner if you want to assign specific read, write, or admin privileges for individual users. Currently, you need to enter each KBase user name if you want to set individual user permissions. In the future, there will be a search feature for finding other KBase users. The "Manage Workspace" window also has a button for deleting a workspace. Keep in mind that you cannot undo deletion of a workspace.</li>
</ol>
<p>Now that you’ve explored some of the features of the My Narratives page, find your new Narrative in the list and click on it to open your empty Narrative:</p>
<div class="screengrab"><img src="/files/1414/0743/1856/narrativeQS14.png" alt="qs4mm.png" width="750" height="362" /></div>
<p>Notice that the data panel in your new Narrative is already populated with data objects that were copied from the Comparative Genomics Narrative. When you create a new Narrative in a new workspace, the data panel will be empty until you add data using KBase’s <a href="http://narrative.kbase.us/functional-site/#/search/?q=*">search interface</a> or upload your own data. In the alpha version of the Narrative Interface, the tools for uploading your own data are currently under development.</p>
<div class="rounded-box" style="width: 25%; float: right; margin: 1em 1em 1em 1em;">
<h3>Save Your Work!</h3>
<p>We are working on enabling autosave for Narratives, but for now, don't forget to click the Save button (the leftmost button) to save your Narrative.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="addcontent">Add Content to your Narrative</h2>
<p>Narratives are composed of an ordered series of sections, or “cells,” that store your analysis steps and commentary. Cells can contain text (to help you record hypotheses, comments, or ideas), or they can hold an analysis step. “Input" cells (with blue borders) let you invoke one of KBase’s analysis functions, with input data and parameter settings of your choosing. "Output" cells (with gray borders) show the output generated from an input cell.</p>
<p>At the top of the Narrative page is a toolbar with a row of buttons that you can use to add cells to or edit your Narrative. If you hover over a button, a short description of its function will appear. Descriptions of these buttons, along with their keyboard shortcuts, are provided below. You can access a list of all keyboard shortcuts at any time in the Narrative Interface by using "Ctrl-m h" (press and hold the "Control" and "m" keys, release, and then press "h").</p>

<p>From the drop-down menu next to the row of buttons, you can select the type of cell to add to your Narrative. By default, an empty code cell is shown when you open a new narrative. The Markdown cell type stores formatted text allowing you to add annotations or descriptions within the Narrative. Other cell types let you insert raw text or headings. In the screenshot below, we selected "Markdown" from the drop-down menu and typed some text into the cell.</p>
<div class="screengrab"><img src="/files/4514/1140/5194/narrativesQScomment.png" alt="narrativesQScomment.png" width="750" /></div>
<p>To exit a cell, simply click outside the cell or press the Shift+Return keys to take you out of the selected cell and into the next cell. (Note that the Narrative Interface will revert back to the default code cell after you have exited a cell of another type.)</p>
<h3>Recreating the Steps in a Narrative</h3>
<p>Opening the Narrative that you want to recreate in a new browser tab will be useful as you recreate the analysis steps in your own Narrative. To do this, first save your Narrative. Now click on “Workspaces” in the top menu and find the Comparative Genomics Narrative in the list. Click on it to open it in a new tab. The screenshot below shows the first step in this Narrative and the first input cell: Build Genome Set Object.</p>
<div class="screengrab"><img src="/files/cache/6dc79c26ef707ca446930607b6ede321.png" alt="qs5mm.png" width="700" /></div>
<p>Return to your new Narrative and find the “Services” menu on the lower left. Each service (or analysis function) has a “?” button next to it that you can click for information about that function.</p>
<div class="screengrab"><img src="/files/cache/749ee762e9d29afe1cf623e17ff872a7.png" alt="qs14mm.png" width="250" /></div>
<p>If you click on a service name, a new input cell will be added to your Narrative, with fields for setting the parameters for that analysis.</p>
<p>To add the “Build Genome Set Object” input cell to your Narrative, click on "Microbes Comparative Genomics" in the services panel and scroll down unto you find it. Click on it to add it to your Narrative.</p>
<div class="screengrab"><img src="/files/cache/3e6dcad09375aff840b1feaa0eaa7bd2.png" alt="qs7mm.png" width="750" /></div>
<p>In the blue top border of the cell, a description of this service was displayed by clicking the "..." button to the right of the function name.</p>
<p>To the left of each text box in an input cell you will see the name of that field (for example, "Output genome set ID"). The text to the right of the box provides more information about what you can enter in that field. When you click on the field for a given input cell, KBase recognizes the data objects from your workspace that are appropriate inputs for that cell and presents you with a drop-down list of options to choose from. In this case, select the first option, Rhodobacter_external_genomes.</p>
<p>When you have entered the parameters for the analysis, click the Run button in the lower right of the cell to execute the function with your supplied parameters. If the run succeeded, you will see an output cell with a gray border. In the top right corner of the output cell border is the time and date when the run completed.</p>
<div class="screengrab"><img src="/files/cache/4ff7aae9ce8ec32f218cd35fe2bf3c19.png" alt="qs8mm.png" width="650" /></div>
<p>You can continue recreating the analysis steps from the Narrative, altering parameters and data if you choose.</p>
<p>The next section will provide instructions on using KBase’s search function to load data to your workspace and then analyze it in the Narrative Interface.</p>
<h3>Searching for Data and Analyzing it in a Narrative</h3>
<p>You can load data selected from your search results to any workspace you own or have admin privileges for. In this section, we will add data to our “home” workspace, which KBase automatically generates for you when you sign up for an account.</p>
<p>To access KBase’s search interface, click on “Search Data” at the top of the page. (Note that if you have not saved your Narrative, KBase will ask you if you want to stay on the page or leave. Be sure to stay on the page and save your Narrative before exiting if you want to retain your latest changes.)</p>
<p>The <a href="http://kbase.us/get-started/data-search-quick-start/">Data Search Quick Start</a> has detailed instructions on how to search, sort, filter, and transfer data objects to your workspace for subsequent analysis with KBase tools. Please refer to it for in-depth information.</p>
<p>Here, we will do a simple keyword search by typing “Escherichia coli<strong><em> </em></strong>” in the search box and pressing Enter or the search icon. Our search returns results in three categories of currently searchable data.</p>
<div class="screengrab"><img src="/files/8214/0743/1951/narrativeQS20.png" alt="qs9mm.png" width="750" /></div>
<p>Click on “Genomes” to access the list of search results for this category. <em></em></p>
<p>From this list, use the checkboxes in the first column to select the  <em>Escherichia coli </em>DEC4C genome. Notice that when you selected this genome, it was added to your Data Cart on the left. The number above the cart indicates that you have one data object in your cart. The number will increase as you select more data objects to add.</p>
<div class="screengrab"><img src="/files/1614/1140/5193/narrativesQScoli.png" alt="narrativesQScoli.png" width="750"/></div>
<p>Once you are finished searching and selecting data, you are ready to transfer your data objects to a workspace of your choosing.</p>
<p>To transfer your selections, click the blue button below the Data Cart to bring up the cart view:</p>
<div class="screengrab"><img src="/files/7514/1140/5231/narrativesQSselect.png" alt="narrativesQSselect.png" width="750" /></div>
<p>This window displays the data objects you selected from your search results and lists the workspaces you may transfer your data to. For this example, choose your “home” workspace.</p>
<p>Once your workspace is selected, use the check boxes beside one or more of your data objects to choose which ones you want to transfer to your workspace. Once selected, click the blue “Copy” button that appears below your workspace name.</p>
<div class="screengrab"><img src="/files/1514/1140/5215/narrativesQSdata.png" alt="narrativesQSdata.png" width="750" /></div>
<p>A status bar will indicate when the transfer is complete. You now can close the Data Cart view by clicking the “x” in the right corner.</p>
<p>Return to Workspace Browser by clicking “Workspaces” in the top menu and locate your home workspace to verify that your <em>E. coli</em> genome (with a KBase ID of kb|g.27872) was transferred to your workspace.</p>
<div class="screengrab"><img src="/files/1114/1140/5223/narrativesQShome.png" alt="narrativesQShome.png" width="750" /></div>
<p>You can now use data from your search results in analysis steps in the Narrative Interface.</p>
<p>Start by creating a new Narrative in your home workspace or open an existing one. (Remember, to create a new Narrative, return to the "Narratives" page and click the "+New Narrative" button at the top.)</p>
<p>Notice the kb|g.27872 genome is listed in the data panel of your Narrative. In this example, we are going to view of list of genes in this genome by using the “View Genome” function under “Microbes Assembly &amp; Genome Import” in the Services panel (see image). Find this service, and click on it to add the "View Genome" input cell to your Narrative.</p>
<div class="screengrab"><img src="/files/cache/749ee762e9d29afe1cf623e17ff872a7.png" alt="qs14mm.png" width="250" /></div>
<p>In the input cell, select the kb|g.27872 genome from the drop-down list and click Run. In the resulting output cell, select the Genes tab to see the list of genes for this <em>E. coli</em> genome.</p>
<div class="screengrab"><img src="/files/9614/1140/5229/narrativesQSoutput.png" alt="narrativesQSoutput.png" width="750" /></div>
<h2 id="apps">Start analyzing your data quickly with Narrative Apps (coming soon)</h2>
<p>We are developing a set of Narrative "apps" that will make it easy to upload and analyze your data with KBase's powerful analysis tools. These apps will be ready-to-use short Narratives that perform a series of useful steps (for example, assemble and annotate a genome). They can be used individually or connected together to form more complex Narratives.</p>
<p> </p>
<hr />
<p>The Narrative User Interface and this documentation are both evolving rapidly. Please check back soon for more information.</p>
