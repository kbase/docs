WORKSPACE SERVICE OVERVIEW
-----------------------------------------
The Workspace Service (WSS) is primarily a language independent remote storage
and retrieval system for KBase typed objects (TO) defined with the KBase
Interface Description Language (KIDL). It has the following primary features:
- Immutable storage of TOs with
	- user defined metadata 
	- data provenance
- Versioning of TOs
- Referencing from TO to TO
- Typechecking of all saved objects against a KIDL specification
- Collecting typed objects into a workspace
- Sharing workspaces with specific KBase users or the world
- Freezing and publishing workspaces

Size limits:
TOs are limited to 0.2GB
TO subdata is limited to 15MB
TO provenance is limited to 1MB

VERSION: 0.1.4 (Released 1/30/14)
--------------------------------------

NEW FEATURES:
- Get the version of the workspace server.
- Set metadata on a workspace and search workspaces by metadata.

UPDATED FEATURES / MAJOR BUG FIXES:
- On startup the WSS attempts to create a node in shock to test for shock
  misconfiguration (shock client change)

ANTICIPATED FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS:
- Rewrite type checker / data extractor for speed and memory usage
- Garbage collection
- Unified WS / Shock ACLs
- Pointers to shock data too large to fit in the workspace
- Get objects by reference chain
- ACLs based on KBase groups
- KBase Search API
- Service Search API (e.g. MongoDB queries on TOs)
- Object sharing queue (share specific versions of objects)
- Import TOs from shock
- Update copied objects from source
- Improvements to returning the subset of an object

VERSION: 0.1.3 (Released 1/24/14)
--------------------------------------

UPDATED FEATURES / MAJOR BUG FIXES:
- Fixed a bug where get_module_info and get_type_info reported removed types.
- Scripts now allow IDs or object references to be used in place of object
  and workspace names.

VERSION: 0.1.2 (Released 1/23/14)
--------------------------------------

Hotfix release to disallow integer object and workspace names.

VERSION: 0.1.1 (Released 1/21/14)
--------------------------------------

BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBILITIES:
- The maximum object size is temporarily limited to 200MB.
- The maximum JSON string size received by the server is temporarily limited
  to 250MB.

NEW FEATURES:
- Add owners to modules so that multiple users can upload typespecs.
- Option to list only deleted objects or workspaces.
- Filter objects or workspaces list by permission level.
- Filter workspaces list by owner.
- Filter object list by the person who saved the object.
- Filter object list by user metadata.
- Return a list of objects that reference another object, either in the object
  data or the provenance data.

UPDATED FEATURES / MAJOR BUG FIXES:
- Module owners can now see unreleased modules and types.
- Turned off parallel garbage collection - was locking the server when
  processing large objects.
- Fixed bug in WS ID relabeling in values of mappings when keys contain forward
  slash character
- Retrieving subset of an object that includes an array element out of the
  array index range now generates an error instead of returning a subset with
  null values in the array
- First error encountered during type checking halts type checking, meaning
  that only the first error is shown to you even if multiple errors exist

ANTICIPATED FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS:
- Garbage collection
- Unified WS / Shock ACLs
- Pointers to shock data too large to fit in the workspace
- Get objects by reference chain
- ACLs based on KBase groups
- KBase Search API
- Service Search API (e.g. MongoDB queries on TOs)
- Object sharing queue (share specific versions of objects)
- Add searchable, mutable metadata to a workspace
- Import TOs from shock
- Update copied objects from source
- Improvements to returning the subset of an object

VERSION: 0.1.0 (Released 1/9/2014)
--------------------------------------
PREAMBLE:
0.1.0 is a complete rewrite of the workspace service and thus has many changes
to the API. A function change list is below.

NEW FEATURES:
- The WSS is configurable to save TOs in MongoDB/GridFS or Shock.
- Load, compile, and view KIDL typespecs.
- Objects are type checked against a KIDL typespec before saving.
- Save provenance information with an object.
- References to other workspace objects in a TO or TO provenance
	are confirmed accessible and type checked before saving.
- A list of references from a TO or TO provenance to other workspace objects is
	saved and retrievable.
- Hide objects. Hidden objects, by default, do not appear in the list_*
	methods.
- Lock a workspace, freezing it permanently. Locked, publicly readable
	workspaces are published.
- Workspaces and objects have a permanent autoincrementing ID as well as a
	mutable name. An object may be addressed by any combination of the
	workspace and object name or id plus a version number, or the KBase ID
	kb|ws.[workspace id].obj.[object id].ver.[object version].
- Workspaces may have a <1000 character description.
- Workspace names may be prefixed by the user's username and a colon. This
	provides a unique per user namespace for workspace names.
- Return only a user specified subset of an object.

UPDATED FEATURES / MAJOR BUG FIXES:
- Many methods now operate on multiple objects rather than one object per
	method call.
- list_objects can list objects from multiple workspaces at once.
- Rename an object or workspace.

ANTICIPATED FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS:
- Garbage collection
- Unified WS / Shock ACLs
- Pointers to shock data too large to fit in the workspace

- Object sharing queue (share specific versions of objects)
- Add mutable metadata to a workspace
- Filter list_workspace_info by metadata, owner, permissions
- Filter list_objects by metadata, owner, permissions
- Import TOs from shock
- Update copied objects from source
- Improvements to returning the subset of an object
- Find TOs that reference another TO
