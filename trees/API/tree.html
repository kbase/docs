     Given a tree in newick format, remove the nodes with the given names indicated in the list, and simplify the tree. Simplifying a tree involves removing unnamed internal nodes that have only one child, and removing unnamed leaf nodes. During the removal process, edge lengths (if they exist) are conserved so that the summed end to end distance between any two nodes left in the tree will remain the same.

     Returns the specified tree in the specified format, or an empty string if the tree does not exist.

    <p>
     The &#39;format&#39; key indicates what string format the tree should be returned in. Currently, there is only support for &#39;newick&#39;. The default value if not specified is &#39;newick&#39;.
    </p>
    <p>
     The &#39;newick_label&#39; key only affects trees returned as newick format, and specifies what should be placed in the label of each leaf. &#39;none&#39; indicates that no label is added, so you get the structure of the tree only. &#39;raw&#39; indicates that the raw label mapping the leaf to an alignement row is used. &#39;feature_id&#39; indicates that the label will have an examplar feature_id in each label (typically the feature that was originally used to define the sequence). Note that exemplar feature_ids are not defined for all trees, so this may result in an empty tree. &#39;protein_sequence_id&#39; indicates that the kbase id of the protein sequence used in the alignment is used. &#39;contig_sequence_id&#39; indicates that the contig sequence id is added. Note that trees are typically built with protein sequences OR contig sequences. If you select one type of sequence, but the tree was built with the other type, then no labels will be added. The default value if none is specified is &#39;raw&#39;.
    </p>
    <p>
     The &#39;newick_bootstrap&#39; key allows control over whether bootstrap values are returned if they exist, and how they are returned. &#39;none&#39; indicates that no bootstrap values are returned. &#39;internal_node_labels&#39; indicates that bootstrap values are returned as internal node labels. Default value is &#39;internal_node_labels&#39;;
    </p>
    <p>
     The &#39;newick_distance&#39; key allows control over whether distance labels are generated or not. If set to &#39;none&#39;, no distances will be output. Default is &#39;raw&#39;, which outputs the distances exactly as they appeared when loaded into kbase.

     This method searches for a tree having a source ID that matches the input pattern. This method accepts one argument, which is the pattern. The pattern is very simple and includes only two special characters, wildcard character, &#39;*&#39;, and a match-once character, &#39;.&#39; The wildcard character matches any number (including 0) of any character, the &#39;.&#39; matches exactly one of any character. These special characters can be escaped with a backslash. To match a blackslash literally, you must also escape it. Note that source IDs are generally defined by the gene family model which was used to identifiy the sequences to be included in the tree. Therefore, matching a source ID is a convenient way to find trees for a specific set of gene families.

     Given an input KBase tree built from a sequence alignment, a metagenomic sample, and a protein family, this method will tabulate the number of reads that match to every leaf of the input tree. First, a set of assembled reads from a metagenomic sample are pulled from the KBase communities service which have been determined to be a likely hit to the specified protein family. Second, the sequences aligned to generate the tree are retrieved. Third, UCLUST [1] is used to map reads to target sequences of the tree. Finally, for each leaf in the tree, the number of hits matching the input search criteria is tabulated and returned. See the defined objects &#39;abundance_params&#39; and &#39;abundance_result&#39; for additional details on specifying the input parameters and handling the results.

     A KBase ID is a string starting with the characters &quot;kb|&quot;. KBase IDs are typed. The types are designated using a short string. For instance,&quot; g&quot; denotes a genome, &quot;tree&quot; denotes a Tree, and &quot;aln&quot; denotes a sequence alignment. KBase IDs may be hierarchical. For example, if a KBase genome identifier is &quot;kb|g.1234&quot;, a protein encoding gene within that genome may be represented as &quot;kb|g.1234.peg.771&quot;.

     A string representation of a phylogenetic tree. The format/syntax of the string is specified by using one of the available typedefs declaring a particular format, such as &#39;newick_tree&#39;, &#39;phyloXML_tree&#39; or &#39;json_tree&#39;. When a format is not explictily specified, it is possible to return trees in different formats depending on addtional parameters. Regardless of format, all leaf nodes in trees built from MSAs are indexed to a specific MSA row. You can use the appropriate functionality of the API to replace these IDs with other KBase Ids instead. Internal nodes may or may not be named. Nodes, depending on the format, may also be annotated with structured data such as bootstrap values and distances.
