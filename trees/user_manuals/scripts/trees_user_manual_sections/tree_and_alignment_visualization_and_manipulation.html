<div><h1>Tree & Alignment Visualization and Manipulation</h1>
<p>The Newick and FASTA representations are convenient for software programs to process, but they are of course difficult to read
by eye.  Because these are standard formats, you can use one of the numerous tree and alignment visualization tools
publicly available to better display your tree.  For simple displays, however, the Tree service provides a
renderer which can diplay a tree or an alignment as an HTML file.  To simply view the structure
of a tree, pipe the output of the 'tree-get-tree' script to the 'tree-to-html' script, and save the output to an html file
named 'myFirstTree.html'. Instead of kb|tree.991753, let's work with kb|tree.994594 which still includes our gene, but has
fewer leaf nodes.
</p>
<pre>
    > <code title = "iris-tutorials">tree-get-tree</code> -p 'kb|tree.994594' | <code title = "iris-tutorials">tree-to-html</code> -raw > myFirstTree.html
</pre>
<p><img src="myFirstTree.png" /></p>
<p><a href="myFirstTree.html">view full tree</a></p>
</div>
<div>
<p>The -raw option states that we want to visualize the tree in its raw form, without any additional automatically generated
links or annotations.  MD5s of course are difficult to read, so instead let's try to view the tree wth feature IDs.</p>
<p>The tree renderer requires that every leaf node is labeled so that it can be identified. Therefore it is safe practice
to include a call to 'tree-remove-nodes', which by default will remove any leaf nodes that are unlabled.  By doing this, we
can view the same tree with feature IDs.  In the command below, we retrieive a tree, replace all IDs with cannonical feature
IDs, remove any nodes that didn't have an associated feature ID, and render the tree, all in one line!</p>
<pre>
    > <code title = "iris-tutorials">tree-get-tree</code> -f 'kb|tree.994594' | <code title = "iris-tutorials">tree-remove-nodes</code> | <code title = "iris-tutorials">tree-to-html</code> > myFirstFeatureLabeledTree.html
</pre>
<p><img src="myFirstFeatureLabeledTree.png" /></p>
<p><a href="myFirstFeatureLabeledTree.html">view full tree</a></p>
</div>
<div>
<p>Although simple, the 'tree-to-html' renderer has several flexible options which allow you to customize how the tree
is diplayed.  Let's work through a more complicated example to demonstrate how we can fetch a tree, retrieve more details
about each node, and display a tree in a way that each leaf node links to a KBase Labs feature browser page.</p>
<p>First, fetch the tree with feature IDs, remove nodes that can't be mapped, and save it to a file.</p>
<pre>
    > <code title = "iris-tutorials">tree-get-tree</code> -f 'kb|tree.994594' | <code title = "iris-tutorials">tree-remove-nodes</code> > my.tree
</pre>
</div>
<div>
<p>Next, get a list of all the leaf nodes, which will be a list of feature IDs, and save the list to a file.</p>
<pre>
    > <code title = "iris-tutorials">tree-get-leaf-nodes</code> -i my.tree > feature.list
    > head feature.list

<p>OPTIONAL - The tree is fairly large, so for the purposes of this tutorial it will be easier/faster to work with a much smaller
tree.  This is easily accomplished.  In the following steps, you can list how many features you have in the tree, create a removal list of
most of the features using a command named 'shuf' to randomly select the removal list (in IRIS you can also use 'head' or 'tail'),
remove those nodes, then get the reduced list of features again.
</p>
<pre>
    > cat feature.list | wc -l
    4315
    > mv my.tree my.tree.original
    > shuf -n 4000 feature.list > feature.removal.list
    > <code title = "iris-tutorials">tree-remove-nodes</code> -i my.tree.original -r feature.removal.list > my.tree
    > cat my.tree | <code title = "iris-tutorials">tree-get-leaf-nodes</code> > feature.list
    > cat feature.list | wc -l
    315
</pre>
</div>
<div>
<p>Now that we have a list of features, we can use the CDMI scripts to get more information about each feature.  For instance,
we use the relationship IsOwnedBy, which maps features to genome data, to extract the scientific name of each genome that
each feature came from.</p>
<pre>
     > cat feature.list | <code title = "iris-tutorials">get_relationship_IsOwnedBy</code> --to scientific_name > feature.data
</pre>
<p>The results of this query are saved to a file named feature.data. </p>
<pre>
    > head feature.data
    kb|g.11.peg.2150	Bacillus amyloliquefaciens LL3

<div>
<p>We can then use a Tree service command to construct URLs to all the feature pages.</p>
<pre>
    > cat feature.list | <code title = "iris-tutorials">tree-create-url-map</code> -u 'http://140.221.92.12/feature_info/feature.html?id=' > feature.links
    > head feature.links

<p>Finally, we can render the tree.</p>
<pre>
cat my.tree | <code title = "iris-tutorials">tree-to-html</code> -a feature.data -l feature.links > niceTreeWithLinks.html
</pre>
<p><img src="niceTreeWithLinks.png" /></p>
<p><a href="niceTreeWithLinks.html">view full tree</a></p>

</div>
