<h2>Retrieving Tree & Alignment Meta Information</h2>
<p>After you have identified a list of potential trees to work with, you can query KBase for additional information about
each tree using the 'tree-get-tree' command.  The simplist usage of the method is to pass a single tree as an argument with the '-m' flag
to indicate that meta data should be returned instead of the actual tree.</p>
<pre>
    > tree-get-tree 'kb|tree.991753' -m
    [tree_id]: kb|tree.991753
    [source_id]: COG840
    [tree_contruction_method]: FastTree2
    [source_db]: MOL:Tree
    [status]: active
    [tree_protocol]: MO Pipeline
    [date_created]: 1359610815
    [leaf_count]: 28931
    [node_count]: 52017
    [tree_construction_parameters]: -fastest
    [alignment_id]: kb|aln.991753
    [type]: sequence_alignment
</pre>
<p>Like many scripts in KBase, the 'tree-get-tree' command can also accept input through standard-in.  This behaviour
allows you to chain together commands to construct more complex queries.  For instance, to get
all meta-data about the trees that include our favorite KBase feature, string together the following commands using
the pipe symbol ('|'), which redirects the output of one command to the input of another command:</p>
<pre>
    > tree-find-tree-ids -f 'kb|g.1870.peg.3915' | tree-get-tree -m
    [tree_id]:	kb|tree.11259
    [source_id]:	tree00011265
    [tree_contruction_method]:	FastTree 2.1.2 SSE3
    [source_db]:	SEED
    [status]:	active
    [tree_protocol]:	Sequences were identified with PSI-BLAST, trimmed to PSI-BLAST profile, aligned and treed
    [date_created]:	1344486561
    [leaf_count]:	9605
    [node_count]:	18203
    [tree_construction_parameters]:	--spr 4 -cat 20
    [alignment_id]:	kb|aln.11259
    [type]:	sequence_alignment
    [tree_id]:	kb|tree.11314
    [source_id]:	tree00011320
    [tree_contruction_method]:	FastTree 2.1.2 SSE3
    [source_db]:	SEED
    [status]:	active
    [tree_protocol]:	Sequences were identified with PSI-BLAST, trimmed to PSI-BLAST profile, aligned and treed
    [date_created]:	1344486766

    [node_count]:	23764
    [tree_construction_parameters]:	--spr 4 -cat 20
    [alignment_id]:	kb|aln.11314
    [type]:	sequence_alignment
    ....
</pre>
<p>Powerfully, this command can then be chained to standard command line tools like 'grep' to retrieve exactly the information
you are interested in.  For instance, if you only care about how many leaf nodes are in the tree and the source database of
the tree, you can execute a query with this command: </p>
<pre>
    > tree-find-tree-ids -f 'kb|g.1870.peg.3915' | tree-get-tree -m | grep 'tree_id\|leaf_count\|source_db'
    [tree_id]:	kb|tree.11259
    [source_db]:	SEED
    [leaf_count]:	9605
    ....
    [source_db]:	MOL:Tree
    [leaf_count]:	26227
    [tree_id]:	kb|tree.993312
    [source_db]:	MOL:Tree
    [leaf_count]:	51082
    ....
</pre>
<p>The same approach can be used to retrieve details about a set of alignments: </p>
<pre>
    > tree-find-alignment-ids -f 'kb|g.1870.peg.3915' | tree-get-alignment -m | \
            grep 'alignment_id\|alignment_construction_method'
    [alignment_id]:	kb|aln.11259
    [alignment_construction_method]:	MAFFT v6.818b
    [alignment_id]:	kb|aln.11314
    [alignment_construction_method]:	MAFFT v6.818b
    ....
    [alignment_id]:	kb|aln.28891
    [alignment_construction_method]:	RPS-BLAST
    [alignment_id]:	kb|aln.30419
    [alignment_construction_method]:	HMMER3
    [alignment_id]:	kb|aln.30458
    [alignment_construction_method]:	HMMER3
    [alignment_id]:	kb|aln.32629
    ....
