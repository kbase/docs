<p>CDMI_API</p>

<h2><a class='u' href='#___top' title='click to go to top of document'
name="DESCRIPTION"
>DESCRIPTION</a></h2>

<p>The CDMI_API defines the component of the Kbase API that supports interaction with instances of the CDM (Central Data Model).
A basic familiarity with these routines will allow the user to extract data from the CS (Central Store).
We anticipate supporting numerous sparse CDMIs in the PS (Persistent Store).</p>

<h3><a class='u' href='#___top' title='click to go to top of document'
name="Basic_Themes"
>Basic Themes</a></h3>

<p>There are several broad categories of routines supported in the CDMI-API.</p>

<p>The simplest is set of &#34;get entity&#34; routines -- each returning data extracted from instances of a single entity type.
These routines all take as input a list of ids referencing instances of a single type of entity.
They construct as output a mapping which takes as input an id and associates as output a set of fields from that instance of the entity.
Each routine allows the user to specify which fields are desired.</p>

<p>For example,
assume you have an input file &#34;Staphylococci,&#34; which is a list of genome IDs for each species of Staphylococcus in the database.
The get_entity_Genome command is used to retrieve detailed information about each genome in the file.
By using different modifiers,
you can specify what kind of information you want to display.
In this example,
the modifier &#34;contigs&#34; was used.
Thus,
the number next to the genome ID in the output file indicates the number of contigs each Staphylococcus genome has.
For a list of available modifiers relating to each identity,
please refer to the ER model.</p>

<pre>        &#62; / cat Staphylococci | cut -f 1 | get_entity_Genome - f contigs
        kb|g.134        2
        kb|g.636        1
        kb|g.2506        15
        kb|g.9303        1
        kb|g.3801        87
        kb|g.2025        46
        kb|g.2516        13
        kb|g.2603        33
        kb|g.19928        2
        kb|g.1852        131
        kb|g.8476        1
        kb|g.2742        46</pre>

<p>To use these routines effectively, a user will need to gradually become familiar with the entities supported in the CDM. We suggest perusing the entity-relationship model that underlies the CDM to get a good introduction.</p>

<p>The next simplest set of routines provide the &#34;get relationship&#34; routines. These take as input a list of ids for a specific entity type, and the give access to the relationship nodes associated with each entity. Thus, get_relationship_WasSubmittedBy takes the input genome ID and outputs the ID with an added column showing the source of that particular genome. It is essential to be able to navigate the ER model to successfully implement these commands, since not all relationship types are applicable to each entity.</p>

<pre>        &#62; / echo &#39;kb|g.0&#39; | get_relationship_WasSubmittedBy -to id
        kb|g.0        SEED</pre>

<p>Of the remaining CDMI-API routines, most are used to extract data by &#34;crossing one or more relationships&#34;. Thus,</p>

<pre>        my $references = $kbO-&#62;fids_to_literature($fids)</pre>

<p>takes as input a list of feature ids referenced by the variable $fids. It creates a hash ($references) which maps each input key to a list of literature references. The construction of the literature references for a given ID involves crossing relationships from the entity &#39;Feature&#39; to &#39;ProteinSequence&#39; to &#39;Publication&#39;. We have attempted to package this specific search in a convenient form. We anticipate that the number of queries of this last class will grow (especially as new entities are added to the model).</p>

<h3><a class='u' href='#___top' title='click to go to top of document'
name="Batching_queries"
>Batching queries</a></h3>

<p>A majority of the CS-API routines take a list of ids as input. Each id may be thought of as input to a query that produces an output result. We support processing an input list, since the performance (which is usually governed by network interactions) is much better if you process a batch of items, rather than invoking the API repeatedly for each of the ids. Normally, the output would be a mapping (a hash for Perl versions) from the input ids to the output results. Thus, a routine like</p>

<pre>             fids_to_literature</pre>

<p>will take a list of feature ids as input. The returned value will be a mapping from feature ids (fids) to publication references.</p>

<p>It is a little inconvenient to batch your requests by supplying a list of fids, but the performance will be much better in most cases. Please note that you are controlling the granularity of each request, and in most cases the size of the input list is not critical. However, you should note that while batching up hundreds or thousands of input ids at a time should work just fine, millions may well cause things to break (e.g., you may exhaust local memory in your machine as the output results are returned). As machines get larger, the appropriate size of the input lists may become largely irrelevant. For now, we recommend that you experiment a bit and use common sense.</p>

<p>We try to associate features and publications, when the publications constitute supporting evidence of the function. We connect a paper to a feature when we believe that an &#34;expert&#34; has asserted that the function of the feature is basically what we have associated with the feature. Thus, we might attach a paper reporting the crystal structure of a protein, even though the paper is clearly not the paper responsible for the original characterization. Our position in this matter is somewhat controversial, but we are seeking to characterize some assertions as relatively solid, and this strategy seems to support that goal. Please note that we certainly wish we could also capture original publications, and when experts can provide those connections, we hope that they will help record the associations.</p>

<p>Kbase supports the creation and maintence of protein families. Each family is intended to contain a set of isofunctional homologs. Currently, the families are collections of translations of features, rather than of just protein sequences (represented by md5s, for example). fids_to_protein_families supports access to the features that have been grouped into a family. Ideally, each feature in a family would have the same assigned function. This is not always true, but probably should be.</p>

<p>One of the most powerful clues to function relates to conserved clusters of genes on the chromosome (in prokaryotic genomes). We have attempted to record pairs of genes that tend to occur close to one another on the chromosome. To meaningfully do this, we need to construct similarity-based mappings between genes in distinct genomes. We have constructed such mappings for many (but not all) genomes maintained in the Kbase CS. The prokaryotic geneomes in the CS are grouped into OTUs by ribosomal RNA (genomes within a single OTU have SSU rRNA that is greater than 97% identical). If two genes occur close to one another (i.e., corresponding genes occur close to one another), then we assign a score, which is the number of distinct OTUs in which such clustering is detected. This allows one to normalize for situations in which hundreds of corresponding genes are detected, but they all come from very closely related genomes.</p>

<p>The significance of the score relates to the number of genomes in the database. We recommend that you take the time to look at a set of scored pairs and determine approximately what percentage appear to be actually related for a few cutoff values.</p>

<p>The routine proteins_to_functions allows users to access functions associated with specific protein sequences. The input proteins are given as a list of MD5 values (these MD5 values each correspond to a specific protein sequence). For each input MD5 value, a list of [feature-id,function] pairs is constructed and returned. Note that there are many cases in which a single protein sequence corresponds to the translation associated with multiple protein-encoding genes, and each may have distinct functions (an undesirable situation, we grant).</p>

<p>This function allows you to access all of the functions assigned (by all annotation groups represented in Kbase) to each of a set of sequences.</p>

<p>The routine proteins_to_roles allows a user to gather the set of functional roles that are associated with specifc protein sequences. A single protein sequence (designated by an MD5 value) may have numerous associated functions, since functions are treated as an attribute of the feature, and multiple features may have precisely the same translation. In our experience, it is not uncommon, even for the best annotation teams, to assign distinct functions (and, hence, functional roles) to identical protein sequences.</p>

<p>For each input MD5 value, this routine gathers the set of features (fids) that share the same sequence, collects the associated functions, expands these into functional roles (for multi-functional proteins), and returns the set of roles that results.</p>

<p>Note that, if the user wishes to see the specific features that have the assigned fiunctional roles, they should use proteins_to_functions instead (it returns the fids associated with each assigned function).</p>

<p>The subsystem_to_spreadsheet routine allows a user to extract the subsystem spreadsheets for a specified set of subsystem names. In the returned output, each subsystem is mapped to a hash that takes as input a genome ID and maps it to the &#34;row&#34; for the genome in the subsystem. The &#34;row&#34; is itself a 2-tuple composed of the variant code, and a mapping from role descriptions to lists of fids. We suggest writing a simple test script to get, say, the subsystem named &#39;Histidine Degradation&#39;, extracting the spreadsheet, and then using something like Dumper to make sure that it all makes sense.</p>

<p>A fid is a &#34;feature id&#34;. A feature represents an ordered list of regions from the contigs of a genome. Features all have types. This allows you to speak of not only protein-encoding genes (PEGs) and RNAs, but also binding sites, large regions, etc. The location of a fid is defined as a list of &#34;location of a contiguous DNA string&#34; pieces (see the description of the type &#34;location&#34;)</p>

<p>A protein_family is thought of as a set of isofunctional, homologous protein sequences. This is not exactly what other groups have meant by &#34;protein families&#34;. There is no hierarchy of super-family, family, sub-family. We plan on loading different collections of protein families, but in many cases there will need to be a transformation into the concept used by Kbase.</p>

<p>The concept of &#34;role&#34; or &#34;functional role&#34; is basically an atomic functional unit. The &#34;function of a protein&#34; is made up of one or more roles. That is, a bifunctional protein with an assigned function of</p>

<p>would implement two distinct roles (the &#34;function1 / function2&#34; notation is intended to assert that the initial part of the protein implements function1, and the terminal part of the protein implements function2). It is worth noting that a protein often implements multiple roles due to broad specificity. In this case, we suggest describing the protein function as</p>

<pre>     function1 @ function2</pre>

<p>That is the &#39; / &#39; separator is used to represent multiple roles implemented by distinct domains of the protein, while &#39; @ &#39; is used to represent multiple roles implemented by distinct domains.</p>

<p>A substem is composed of two components: a set of roles that are gathered to be annotated simultaneously and a spreadsheet depicting the proteins within each genome that implement the roles. The set of roles may correspond to a pathway, a complex, an inventory (say, &#34;transporters&#34;) or whatever other principle an annotator used to formulate the subsystem.</p>

<p>The subsystem spreadsheet is a list of &#34;rows&#34;, each representing the subsytem in a specific genome. Each row includes a variant code (indicating what version of the molecular machine exists in the genome) and cells. Each cell is a 2-tuple:</p>

<pre>     [role,protein-encoding genes that implement the role in the genome]</pre>

<p>Annotators construct subsystems, and in the process impose a controlled vocabulary for roles and functions.</p>

<p>We now have a number of types and functions relating to ObservationalUnits (ous), alleles and traits. We think of a reference genome and a set of ous that have measured differences (SNPs) when compared to the reference genome. Each allele is associated with a position on a contig of the reference genome. Prior analysis has associated traits with the alleles that impact them. We are interested in supporting operations that locate genes in the region of an allele (i.e., genes of the reference genome that are in a region containining an allele). Similarly, we wish to locate the alleles that impact a trait, map the alleles to regions, loacte the possibly impacted genes, relate these to subsystems, etc.</p>

<p>Reactions do not connect directly to roles. Rather, the conceptual model is that one or more roles together form a complex. A complex implements one or more reactions. The actual data relating to a complex is spread over two entities: Complex and ReactionComplex. It is convenient to be able to offer access to the complex name, the reactions it implements, and the roles that make it up in a single invocation.</p>
