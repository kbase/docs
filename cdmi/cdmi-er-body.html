<p>An alignment arranges a group of protein sequences so that they match. Each alignment is associated with a phylogenetic tree that describes how the sequences developed and their evolutionary distance. The actual tree and alignment FASTA are stored in separate flat files. The Kbase will maintain a set of alignments and associated trees. The majority of these will be based on protein sequences. We will not have a comprehensive set but we will have tens of thousands of such alignments, and we view them as an imporant resource to support annotation. The alignments/trees will include the tools and parameters used to construct them. Access to the underlying sequences and trees in a form convenient to existing tools will be supported.</p>

<p>An atomic regulon is an indivisible group of coregulated features on a single genome. Atomic regulons are constructed so that a given feature can only belong to one. Because of this, the expression levels for atomic regulons represent in some sense the state of a cell. An atomicRegulon is a set of protein-encoding genes that are believed to have identical expression profiles (i.e., they will all be expressed or none will be expressed in the vast majority of conditions). These are sometimes referred to as &#34;atomic regulons&#34;. Note that there are more common notions of &#34;coregulated set of genes&#34; based on the notion that a single regulatory mechanism impacts an entire set of genes. Since multiple other mechanisms may impact overlapping sets, the genes impacted by a regulatory mechanism need not all share the same expression profile. We use a distinct notion (CoregulatedSet) to reference sets of genes impacted by a single regulatory mechanism (i.e., by a single transcription regulator).</p>

<p>ContigChunks are strings of DNA thought of as being a string in a 4-character alphabet with an associated ID. We allow a broader alphabet that includes U (for RNA) and the standard ambiguity characters. The notion of ContigChunk was introduced to avoid transferring/manipulating huge contigs to access small substrings. A ContigSequence is formed by concatenating a set of one or more ContigChunks. Thus, ContigChunks are the basic units moved from the database to memory. Their existence should be hidden from users in most circumstances (users are expected to request substrings of ContigSequences, and the Kbase software locates the appropriate ContigChunks).</p>

<p>ContigSequences are strings of DNA. Contigs have an associated genome, but ContigSequences do not.. We can think of random samples of DNA as a set of ContigSequences.

<p>The Kbase will support the maintenance of protein families (as sets of Features with associated translations). We are initially only supporting the notion of a family as composed of a set of isofunctional homologs. That is, the families we initially support should be thought of as containing protein-encoding genes whose associated sequences all implement the same function (we do understand that the notion of &#34;function&#34; is somewhat ambiguous, so let us sweep this under the rug by calling a functional role a &#34;primitive concept&#34;). We currently support families in which the members are translations of features, and we think of Features as having an associated function. Identical protein sequences as products of translating distinct genes may or may not have identical functions, and we allow multiple members of the same Family to share identical protein sequences. This may be justified, since in a very, very, very few cases identical proteins do, in fact, have distinct functions. We would prefer to reach the point where our Families are sets of protein sequence, rather than sets of protein-encoding Features.</p>

<p>Annotators attach publications to ProteinSequences. The criteria we have used to gather such connections is a bit nonstandard. We have sought to attach publications to ProteinSequences when the publication includes an expert asserting a belief or estimate of function. The paper may not be the original characterization. Further, it may not even discuss a sequence protein (much of the literature is very valuable, but reports work on proteins in strains that have not yet been sequenced). On the other hand, reports of sequencing regions of a chromosome (with no specific assertion of a clear function) should not be attached. The attached publications give an ID (usually a Pubmed ID), a URL to the paper (when we have it), and a title (when we have it).</p>

<p>This entity represents a compound as it is used by a specific reaction. A reaction involves many compounds, and a compound can be involved in many reactions. The reagent describes the use of the compound by a specific reaction. It has the following fields:</p>

<dl>
<dt><a name="stoichiometry"
>stoichiometry</a></dt>

<dd>
<p>Number of molecules of the compound that participate in a single instance of the reaction. For example, if a reaction produces two water molecules, the stoichiometry of water for the reaction would be two. When a reaction is written on paper in chemical notation, the stoichiometry is the number next to the chemical formula of the compound. The value is negative for substrates and positive for products.</p>

<p>A feature is a set of DNA sequence fragments. Most features are a single contiquous fragment, so they are located in only one DNA sequence; however, fragments have a maximum length, so even a single contiguous feature may participate in this relationship multiple times. A few features belong to multiple DNA sequences. In that case, however, all the DNA sequences belong to the same genome. A DNA sequence itself will frequently have thousands of features connected to it. It has the following fields:</p>

<p>A fid is a &#34;feature id&#34;. A feature represents an ordered list of regions from the contigs of a genome. Features all have types. This allows you to speak of not only protein-encoding genes (PEGs) and RNAs, but also binding sites, large regions, etc. The location of a fid is defined as a list of &#34;location of a contiguous DNA string&#34; pieces (see the description of the type &#34;location&#34;)</p>

<p>A protein_family is thought of as a set of isofunctional, homologous protein sequences. This is not exactly what other groups have meant by &#34;protein families&#34;.

<p>The concept of &#34;role&#34; or &#34;functional role&#34; is basically an atomic functional unit. The &#34;function of a protein&#34; is made up of one or more roles. That is, a bifunctional protein with an assigned function of</p>

<p>would implement two distinct roles (the &#34;function1 / function2&#34; notation is intended to assert that the initial part of the protein implements function1, and the terminal part of the protein implements function2). It is worth noting that a protein often implements multiple roles due to broad specificity. In this case, we suggest describing the protein function as</p>

<pre>     function1 @ function2</pre>

<p>That is the &#39; / &#39; separator is used to represent multiple roles implemented by distinct domains of the protein, while &#39; @ &#39; is used to represent multiple roles implemented by distinct domains.</p>

<p>A substem is composed of two components: a set of roles that are gathered to be annotated simultaneously and a spreadsheet depicting the proteins within each genome that implement the roles. The set of roles may correspond to a pathway, a complex, an inventory (say, &#34;transporters&#34;) or whatever other principle an annotator used to formulate the subsystem.</p>

<p>The subsystem spreadsheet is a list of &#34;rows&#34;, each representing the subsytem in a specific genome. Each row includes a variant code (indicating what version of the molecular machine exists in the genome) and cells. Each cell is a 2-tuple:</p>

<pre>     [role,protein-encoding genes that implement the role in the genome]</pre>

<p>Reactions do not connect directly to roles. Rather, the conceptual model is that one or more roles together form a complex. A complex implements one or more reactions. The actual data relating to a complex is spread over two entities: Complex and ReactionComplex. It is convenient to be able to offer access to the complex name, the reactions it implements, and the roles that make it up in a single invocation.</p>
