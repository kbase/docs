<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>This tutorial will help you install kbase.app and work directly with KBase
tools at an interactive shell prompt. </p>
<p>The easiest way to get started with the KBase tools in this manner
is to use the downloadable Mac application bundle for the KBase. The
application bundle contains an installation of the KBase toolkit and
the runtime support code required for the toolkit. It also contains
tools for creating a local development environment and for bundling a
development environment into a new application bundle, thus enabling
users to redistribute the KBase toolkit with additional functionality.
Tools developed in this environment are additionally candidates for
easy integration into the official KBase software releases and the
publicly accessible Iris site.
</p>
<h2>Installing the KBase Application Bundle</h2>
<p>The KBase application bundle is available for download at the KBase
tools site:
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="http://kbase.us/downloads" target="_blank" title="KBase download site">http://kbase.us/downloads</a>
</p>
<p>Click on the link named "KBase-Mac.dmg" and save the file to your
local machine.&nbsp;<br>
</p>
<p><img alt="Mac downloads list." src="kbmac_dl_list.png" style="width: 428px; height: 231px;"></p>
<p>Open the file by double clicking the downloaded file; you should see
a window open with the KBase application in it:

</p>

folder, just drag the KBase icon onto the Applications icon. You will
then see a status window:<br>

<p align="left">The application will be installed on your
computer. To start it, go to your Applications folder and doubleclick
the KBase icon. The first time you run it you will see a warning about
a newly downloaded application:
<br>
</p>
<p align="left"><img alt="Internet warning from first run." src="kbmac_app_first_run2.png" style="width: 488px; height: 160px;"></p>
<p align="left">Click "Open." A Terminal.app window will
open and you will be able to run KBase commands there.

You are now able to work through any of the KBase tutorials. You should be able to enter commands directly at this prompt and in this location.</p>
