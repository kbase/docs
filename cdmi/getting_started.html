</p><h2>Introduction</h2>
 This tutorial will help you get started using the KBase. In order to use the KBase command line scripts as we discuss in these tutorials, you will need to install the KBase client software on your computer. The KBase software is a collection of libraries and command scripts written in the perl programming language. There are several different routes toward installing this software; choosing the appropriate one depends on your experience. <h2>CPAN installation</h2>
 The perl community maintains a site called the <a href="http://www.cpan.org/"> Comprehensive Perl Archive Network</a>. This site is the canonical repository of third-party perl code releases. The <a name="CPAN66">CPAN</a>
 project maintains a <a href="http://www.cpan.org/modules/INSTALL.html" name="CPAN67">general tutorial for installing CPAN modules</a>
. (Please note that while we will be making the software public on <a name="CPAN68">CPAN</a>
, there is a lag between when it is uploaded and when it appears on the <a name="CPAN69">CPAN</a>
 mirror sites. The latest version will always be available at the KBase download site at <a href="http://kbase.us/index.php/developers/downloads/"> http://kbase.us/index.php/developers/downloads/</a>

.) <p> The KBase developers publish stable snapshots of the KBase perl code to the <a name="CPAN70">CPAN</a> repository on a regular basis. If you are familiar with the perl tools and have installed packages using <a name="CPAN71">CPAN</a> it will be a simple process to install the software using <a name="CPAN72">CPAN</a>: </p><pre>   cpan Bio::KBase<br></pre> This command will download and install the latest version of the KBase software into your perl installation. Please note that if you are using for instance the system installation of perl on a Linux or Mac system that you will need to be able to have write access to the perl installation. In this case you will need to use the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudo">sudo</a> command to raise your privileges appropriately: <pre>  sudo cpan Bio::KBase<br></pre> If you have problems with using the cpan installation you may wish to install another tool called <i>cpanminus</i>. It is installed using cpan: <pre>  cpan App::cpanminus<br></pre> which then allows you to use the <i>cpanm</i> command: <pre>  cpanm Bio::Kbase<br></pre> If you are a Windows user, the <a href="http://strawberryperl.com/">Strawberry Perl</a> distribution works well with the KBase software. Just download the installer from the Strawberry Perl homepage, install it, then bring up a command prompt window and run <pre>  cpan Bio::KBase<br></pre> and you should be ready to use the KBase scripts. Unfortunately, the Windows command line environment does not include the unix utilities like <i><a name="cut73">cut</a></i>, <i><a name="grep74">grep</a></i>, etc. that we use in the tutorials. 

<h2>Prepackaged Installations</h2>
 If you use a Windows or Mac computer there is a prepackaged alternative to the <a name="CPAN75">CPAN</a>
 solution. The <a name="SEED76">SEED</a>
 project maintains a tool called myRAST which is a GUI-based genome browser and genome annotation system, but as a side benefit it includes a fully packaged installation of perl with the prerequisites required for running the KBase software. <p><i>The myRAST version of the software is not yet ready for download.</i>
</p><h2>Where to find software</h2>
 The latest version will always be available at the KBase download site at <a href="http://kbase.us/index.php/developers/downloads/"> http://kbase.us/index.php/developers/downloads/</a>
