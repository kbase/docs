<h1>Getting Started with the KBase</h1>

In order to use the KBase command line scripts as we discuss in these tutorials,
you will need to install the KBase client software on your computer.  This tutorial
will help you get started using the KBase.

The KBase software is
a collection of libraries and command scripts written in the perl programming language. There
are several different routes toward installing this software; choosing the appropriate 
one depends on your experience.

<h2>CPAN installation</h2>

The perl community maintains a site called the <a href="http://www.cpan.org/">
Comprehensive Perl Archive Network</a>. This site is the canonical repository of 
third-party perl code releases. The CPAN project maintains a 
<a href="http://www.cpan.org/modules/INSTALL.html">general tutorial for 
installing CPAN modules</a>.
<p>
The KBase developers publish stable snapshots of the KBase perl code to the
CPAN repository on a regular basis. If you are familiar with the perl tools and have installed 
packages using CPAN it will be a simple process to install the software
using CPAN:
<pre>
   cpan Bio::KBase
</pre>

This command will download and install the latest version of the KBase software into
your perl installation. Please note that if you are using for instance the system
installation of perl on a Linux or Mac system that you will need to be able to have
write access to the perl installation. In this case you will need to use the 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudo">sudo</a> command to raise your privileges
appropriately:
<pre>
  sudo cpan Bio::KBase
</pre>

If you have problems with using the cpan installation you may wish to install another
tool called <i>cpanminus</i>. It is installed using cpan:
<pre>
  cpan App::cpanminus
</pre>

which then allows you to use the <i>cpanm</i> command:
<pre>
  cpanm Bio::Kbase
</pre>

<h2>Prepackaged Installations</h2>

If you use a Windows or Mac computer there is a prepackaged alternative to the CPAN solution.
The SEED project maintains a tool called myRAST which is a GUI-based genome browser and
genome annotation system, but as a side benefit it includes a fully packaged installation of 
perl with the prerequisites required for running the KBase software. 
<p>
<i>The myRAST version of the software is not yet ready for download.</i>

<h2>Where to find software</h2>

While we will be making the software public on CPAN, there is a lag between when it 
is uploaded and when it appears on the CPAN mirror sites. The latest version will always
be available at the KBase download site at
