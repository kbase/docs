<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The KBase IRIS web interface provides an excellent introduction to
the data browsing and analysis tools provided by KBase.
However, IRIS alone does not provide a mechanism for the user to add
new commands to the system. In order to do this, one needs to take a
step further into the KBase ecosystem and work directly with KBase
tools at an interactive shell prompt.
</p>
<p>The easiest way to get started with the KBase tools in this manner
is to use the downloadable Mac application bundle for the KBase. The
application bundle contains an installation of the KBase toolkit and
the runtime support code required for the toolkit. It also contains
tools for creating a local development environment and for bundling a
development environment into a new application bundle, thus enabling
users to redistribute the KBase toolkit with additional functionality.
Tools developed in this environment are additionally candidates for
easy integration into the official KBase software releases and the
publicly accessible Iris site.

<h2>Installing the KBase Application Bundle</h2>
<p>The KBase application bundle is available for download at the KBase
tools site:
</p>

</p>
<p>Click on the link named "KBase-Mac.dmg" and save the file to your
local machine.&nbsp;

</p>
<p><img alt="Mac downloads list." src="/docs/cdmi/kbmac_dl_list.png" style="width: 428px; height: 231px;"><br>
</p>
<p>Open the file by doubleclicking the downloaded file; you should see
a window open with the KBase application in it:

<p align="left">and then the application will be installed on your
computer. To start it, go to your Applications folder and doubleclick
the KBase icon. The first time you run it you will see a warning about
a newly downloaded application:

<p align="left">Go ahead and click "Open". A Terminal.app window will
open and you will be able to run KBase commands there.
