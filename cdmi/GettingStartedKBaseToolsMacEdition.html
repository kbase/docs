<h1>Getting Started with the KBase Tools: Mac Edition</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The KBase Iris web interface provides an excellent introduction to the data browsing and analysis tools provide by the KBase project. However, Iris alone does not provide a mechanism for the user to add new commands to the system. In order to do this, one needs to take a step further into the KBase ecosystem and work directly with the KBase tools at an interactive shell prompt.
<p>The easiest way to get started with the KBase tools in this manner is to use the downloadable Mac application bundle for the KBase. The application bundle contains an installation of the KBase toolkit and the runtime support code required for the toolkit. It also contains tools for creating a local development environment and for bundling a development environment into a new application bundle, thus enabling users to redistribute the KBase toolkit with additional functionality. Tools developed in this environment are additionally candidates for easy integration into the official KBase software releases and the publicly accessible Iris site.
<h2>Installing the KBase Application Bundle</h2>
<p>The KBase application bundle is available for download at the KBase tools site:
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="http://kbase.us/downloads" target="_blank" title="KBase download site">http://kbase.us/downloads</a>
<p>Click on the link named &quot;KBase-Mac.dmg&quot; and save the file to your local machine.&nbsp;

<p><img alt="Mac downloads list." src="/docs/cdmi/kbmac_dl_list.png" style="width: 428px; height: 231px;" /><br />
<p>Open the file by doubleclicking the downloaded file; you should see a window open with the KBase application in it:

<p align="left">and then the application will be installed on your computer. To start it, go to your Applications folder and doubleclick the KBase icon. The first time you run it you will see a warning about a newly downloaded application:

<p align="left">Go ahead and click &quot;Open&quot;. A Terminal.app window will open and you will be able to run KBase commands there.
