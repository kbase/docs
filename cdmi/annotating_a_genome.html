<h1>Annotating a Genome Using KBase Tools</h1>

<p>
<strong>Purpose:</strong> This tutorial demonstrates how to annotate a
set of closely related genomes using KBase tools.  We will show how to
annotate several strains from the genus <i>Geobacter</i>.  Annotating
multiple strains can be useful for studying differences between
strains and identifying the pan-genome (i.e., the superset of all
genes shared by closely related strains).  We will also demonstrate
how to construct <a name="metabolic315">metabolic</a> models to
clarify differences between strains.

<p>
This tutorial assumes you're using the IRIS web interface to access
KBase.  However, you should also be able to follow the same procedure
on your local computer so long as it has standard UNIX command line
tools and the KBase software installed as described in the prerequisite
tutorial below:

<p>
<strong>Required Prerequisite Activities:</strong> 
<a href="/for-users/tutorials/installing-the-kbase-app-dmg/">Download KBase: Installing the KBase Application DMG</a>, OR <a href="for-users/tutorials/navigating-iris/">Get Started with IRIS: Navigating IRIS</a> </p>

<p>

<h2>Select a genome</h2>

To see which <i>Geobacter</i> genomes are in the <a name="Central Store316">Central Store</a> of KBase, use the command:

<pre>
<a href="http://kbase.us/developer-zone/api-documentation/cdm-entity-relationship-command-scripts/#all_entities_Genome" target="_blank">all_entities_Genome</a> -f scientific_name | grep Geobacter
</pre>

<p>
You should get back a two-column table showing the available strains
of <i>Geobacter</i>.  The first column gives the KBase genome ID, and
the second column gives the strain name.  Note that it's not unusual
for multiple genomes to share a strain name (e.g., due to strains
being sampled and sequenced multiple times).  However, each will have
a unique genome identifier, and strains with the same name often have
different genome sequences.  Here is the output from the above command:

<p>
<pre>
kb|g.1495   Geobacter sp. M18
kb|g.1494   Geobacter sp. M18
kb|g.21614  Geobacter sp. M21
kb|g.1278   Geobacter lovleyi SZ
kb|g.9264   Geobacter sp. FRC-32
kb|g.483    Geobacter sulfurreducens PCA
kb|g.9716   Geobacter lovleyi SZ
kb|g.21325  Geobacter uraniumreducens Rf4
kb|g.1029   Geobacter uraniireducens Rf4
kb|g.1314   Geobacter bemidjiensis Bem
kb|g.1496   Geobacter sp. M21
kb|g.2860   Geobacter sulfurreducens KN400
kb|g.21512  Geobacter bemidjiensis Bem
kb|g.9032   Geobacter metallireducens GS-15
kb|g.835    Geobacter sp. FRC-32
kb|g.20945  Geobacter sulfurreducens PCA
kb|g.589    Geobacter metallireducens GS-15 
</pre>

<p>
The genome <i>Geobacter sulfurreducens</i> KN400 (KBase ID
"kb|g.2860") is a good example to start with.

<p>
<h2>Get a FASTA file of contigs from the KBase Central Store</h2>

<p>
We will start by making a local copy of the contigs from
<i>Geobacter sulfurreducens</i> KN400 (KBase ID "kb|g.2860")
using the command:

<p>
<pre>
echo 'kb|g.2860' | <a href="http://kbase.us/developer-zone/api-documentation/cdm-command-line-scripts/#genomes_to_contigs" target="_blank">genomes_to_contigs</a> | <a href="http://kbase.us/developer-zone/api-documentation/cdm-command-line-scripts/#contigs_to_sequences" target="_blank">contigs_to_sequences</a> &gt; g.2860.contigs
</pre>

<p>
This puts the contig sequences into a file called g.2860.contigs.

<p>
Note that at this stage, rather than getting sequence data from the
KBase Central Store, we could have used any sequence data.  For
example, if you have sequence data for some newly sequenced microbe,
you could upload it to KBase through the IRIS web interface into your
work area.

<p>
<h2>Create project subdirectories</h2>

<p>
We will create subdirectories to contain each separate genome.  Let's
start by making subdirectory called <i>g.2860</i> where we will
annotate kb|g.2860:

<p>
<pre>
mkdir g.2860
mv g.2860.contigs g.2860
cd g.2860
ls
</pre>

<p>
The first command creates the subdirectory, the second moves our
contig file into the subdirectory, the third changes into the
subdirectory, and the last displays the contents of the subdirectory.

<p>
If you're using IRIS, don't use any characters in your filenames that
have special meaning in UNIX shells; e.g., in this case the 'kb|'
prefix for the genome was omitted.

<p>
<h2>Create a genome object to annotate</h2>

<p>
Next, use the FASTA file of contigs to create a "genome object" for our
strain using the command:

<p>
<!-- needs links to API doc: -->
<pre>
fasta_to_genome 'Geobacter sulfurreducens KN400' Bacteria 11 &lt; g.2860.contigs &gt; genome
</pre>

<p>
The genome object (in the file called "genome") contains the contigs,
the scientific name of the organism, the domain (we specified
"Bacteria"), and the genetic code for the organism (i.e., 11, which is
the code most commonly used with prokaryotic genomes). Use <em>ls</em>
to see the file, and then click on it in IRIS to see the encoded fields).
Note that we have named our project subdirectory g.2860, which
reflects the name of the genome whose contigs we copied.  The next
step is to re-annotate the contigs, generating a whole new genome.

<p>
<h2>Annotate a genome object</h2>

<p>
We next create an initial annotation for the genome using the
command:

<p>
<!-- needs links to API doc: -->
<pre>
annotate_genome &lt; genome &gt; annotated.genome
</pre>

<p>
This command causes an initial annotation to be generated (stored in
the file "annotated.genome").  It may take several minutes for large
genomes.  In IRIS, you can issue other commands while you wait, and
the completion message will display below the command when the
annotation is complete. When it finishes, you can use <em>ls</em> to
see the generated file, and click on it to download and view the
encoded <a name="annotations317">annotations</a>.  Annotated regions
of a genome in KBase are called "features."

<p>
An alternative method of viewing the features that were generated
in the annotated genome object is to use the command:

<p>
<!-- needs links to API doc: -->
<pre>
genomeTO_to_feature_data &lt; annotated.genome &gt; features.txt
</pre>

<p>
This command produces a tab-separated table containing four columns:
the feature ID, location on the genome, feature type, and assigned
function.  Use <em>ls</em> to see the file and explore the contents.

<p>
<h2>Build a metabolic reconstruction from an annotated genome</h2>

<p>
<!-- the link to SEED subsystems below should go to a KBase help
page, and the word SEED should then be eliminated -->
The term "<a name="metabolic318">metabolic</a> reconstruction" as used
here roughly means <i>a set
of <a href="http://www.theseed.org/wiki/Glossary#Subsystem"
name="subsystems319" target="blank_">SEED subsystems</a> that are
annotated as present in the genome, along with the relevant variant
codes</i>.  A subsystem is a group of functionally related roles
(e.g., a metabolic pathway).

<p>
We obtain an initial <a name="metabolic320">metabolic</a>
reconstruction for the annotated genome using the command:

<p>
<!-- needs links to API doc: -->
<pre>
genomeTO_to_reconstructionTO &lt; annotated.genome &gt; reconstruction
</pre>

<p>
(The above command is not a typo; the "TO" stands for "typed object.")

<p>
The reconstruction includes a list of functional roles for which a
gene was identified.  A "role" is a term indicating a function that a
single gene or gene product may have in a cell.  Many, but not all,
correspond to enzymes in metabolic pathways.  To see a list of all the
roles that were found in your reconstruction, use the command:

<p>
<!-- needs links to API doc: -->
<pre>
reconstructionTO_to_roles &lt; reconstruction &gt; roles
</pre>

<p>
To see the <a name="subsystems321">subsystems</a> (along with the
variant codes that were assigned), use the command:

<p>
<!-- needs links to API doc: -->
<pre>
reconstructionTO_to_subsystems &lt; reconstruction &gt; subsystems
</pre>

<p>
You can view the contents of the "subsystems" file to see which
subsystems are present in the metabolic reconstuction.  Note that some
subsystems are listed as missing, while others are listed as present
in the genome.

<p>
<h2>Find roles that might impact metabolic models</h2>

<p>
How good are the <a name="annotations322">annotations</a> for your
newly-annotated genome? One way to assess this is to focus on the
roles that might impact <a name="metabolic323">metabolic</a>
models. We can look at the ones that were found and then compare them
against those that exist in a similar, manually-curated genome.  Let's
begin by getting the subset of the roles that might impact
the <a name="metabolic324">metabolic</a> models in KBase:

<p>
<pre>
<a href="http://kbase.us/developer-zone/api-documentation/cdm-command-line-scripts/#all_roles_used_in_models" target="_blank">all_roles_used_in_models</a> &gt; all.roles
<!-- needs links to API doc: -->
a_and_b roles all.roles &gt; roles.for.models
</pre>

The first command finds all roles used in KBase metabolic models (storing
them in the file "all.roles").  The second command finds the intersection
between all roles and the roles in the initial reconstruction (storing
the result in the file "roles.for.models").

<p>
<h2>Compare roles with those found in another strain</h2>

<p>
It is often useful to compare the set of roles found in your
reconstucted genome with those from another organism; for example, We
might compare with a well-tested reconstruction or a manually curated
model for a closely related organism in order to see if we can find
any clear mistakes in the new reconstruction.  (This step is not
strictly required; if you want, you can skip to creating a model.)

<p>
As an example, we'll compare our automatically generated set of roles
against the set found in another <i>Geobacter</i>
species, <i>Geobacter metallireducens</i> GS-15 (KBase ID
"kb|g.9032").  Obtain the roles for that genome using the commands:

<p>
<pre>
echo 'kb|g.9032' | <a href="http://kbase.us/developer-zone/api-documentation/cdm-command-line-scripts/#genomes_to_fids" target="_blank">genomes_to_fids</a> CDS | <a href="http://kbase.us/developer-zone/api-documentation/cdm-command-line-scripts/#fids_to_roles" target="_blank">fids_to_roles</a> 2&gt; /dev/null | cut -f 3 &gt; roles.in.g.9032
</pre>

<p>
Note that the
command <b><a href="http://kbase.us/developer-zone/api-documentation/cdm-command-line-scripts/#fids_to_roles"
target="_blank">fids_to_roles</a></b> writes error messages when it
cannot match a fid to any roles, so the commands above redirect all
warning messages to /dev/null so they don't clutter up the output.

<p>
Next, we'll find potentially missing roles in our reconstruction
of <i>Geobacter metallireducens GS-15</i>, using the commands:

<p>
<!-- needs links to API doc: -->
<pre>
a_and_b roles.in.g.9032 all.roles &gt; roles.for.models.g.9032
a_not_b roles.for.models roles.for.models.g.9032 &gt; roles.to.search.for
</pre>

<p>
This creates a file of roles in <i>Geobacter metallireducens GS-15</i>
that are not yet found in the <a name="annotations325">annotations</a>
we got back for our re-annotated version of <i>Geobacter
sulfurreducens KN400</i>.

<p>
You can manually inspect the file, to determine whether or not any
roles that should be there seem to be missing.  Missing roles may
indicate errors in the new reconstruction, or they may indicate
real differences in the biology of the two microbes.

<p>
<h2>Create an initial metabolic model</h2>

<p>
Now that we have an annotated genome, we can create an
initial <a name="metabolic326">metabolic</a> model using the command:

<p>
<!-- needs links to API doc: -->
<pre>
genome_to_fbamodel &lt; annotated.genome &gt; initial.model
</pre>

<p>
After a minute or two, a <a name="metabolic327">metabolic</a> model
object is stored in a file (named "initial.model").

<p>
<h2>View the model</h2>

<p>
We can convert this model into readable HTML to see what it
contains, using the command:

<p>
<!-- needs links to API doc: -->
<pre>
fbamodel_to_html &lt; initial.model &gt; initial.model.html
</pre>

<p>
After that command completes, use <em>ls</em> and click on the
generated html.

<p>
<h2>Run flux balance analysis on the metabolic model</h2>

<p>
Flux balance analysis (FBA) is a mathematical approach in which our
model is used to simulate various cellular activities, typically the
production of biomass or metabolites from transportable nutrients. Now
that we have a model, apply flux balance analysis in order to
determine whether our model can grow, and to discover which pathways
are used during growth.

<p>
<!-- needs links to API doc: -->
<pre>
runfba &lt; initial.model &gt; solution.html
</pre>

<p>
The results from the FBA are printed in HTML in the output solution
file. Simply run the <em>ls</em> command and click on the HTML file to
view the solution.

<p>
At the top of this file is a table of the parameters used to run the
FBA. Directly below this table is another table showing the objective
function and value. In all likelihood, your model did not grow at
all. This is because the model is missing pathways needed for biomass
production. When a model fails to grow, the FBA command attempst to
diagnose the problem by identifying biomass components that cannot be
produced. This is done by maximizing the production of each individual
biomass component, one at a time. You can see these analysis results
in your solution HTML file (see the metabolite production table). Note
that some of your biomass components have no numbers in this
table. These are the components that cannot be produced.

<p>
Next, we will try to fix the model by adding reactions to enable
production of these components.

<p>
<h2>Gapfill the model</h2>

<p>
We can run a gapfilling command on our model to automatically add
reactions as needed to enable the production of all biomass
components:

<p>
<!-- needs links to API doc: -->
<pre>
gapfill_fbamodel &lt; initial.model &gt; gapfilled.model
</pre>

<p>
Depending on the size and state of the genome, this could take minutes
to hours, but when the analysis is complete, your model will have
additional reactions in it, reflecting the ideal solution identified
by the gapfilling algorithm to enable growth.

<p>
We next re-run flux balance analysis to determine the biomass
production pathways of the organism.

<p>
<h2>Run flux balance analysis on the gapfilled model</h2>

<p>
Now that the model has been gapfilled, it should be possible to
simulate biomass production using flux balance analysis.  Use
the runfba command again:

<p>
<!-- needs links to API doc: -->
<pre>
runfba &lt; gapfilled.model &gt; solution.html
</pre>

<p>
Once this command completes, use <em>ls</em> and click on the HTML
produced by the FBA command. Your FBA solution should now include a
nonzero objective value as well as numerous compound and reaction
fluxes.

<p>
<h2>Export the model to external tools</h2>

<p>
Many other tools now exist that enable the analysis of
genome-scale <a name="metabolic328">metabolic</a> models (e.g., the
Cobra toolbox). Most of these tools read models printed in SBML
format. Export the gapfilled model in SBML format so the model can be
used with these tools:

<p>
<!-- needs links to API doc: -->
<pre>
fbamodel_to_sbml &lt; gapfilled.model &gt; gapfilled.model.sbml
</pre>

<p>
After the command completes, use <em>ls</em> and select the SBML file
for download.
