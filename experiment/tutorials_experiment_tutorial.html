<h2>Generating input data for growmatch</h2>

<p>In a modeling context, the main purpose of the experiment store and service
is to store and process data suitable for metabolic model validation. This 
section of the tutorial will show you how to extract data from the CDS in a 
format appropriate for input into growmatch  (GM) validation algorithms, 
although a thresholding step will be required prior to  submission to a GM 
algorithm.</p>

<p>There are many input options to the main search command, 
exp_find_growmatch_data, but here we will only focus on a few common ones. For
more details, run the script with the --help option.</p>

<h3>Finding experiments of interest</h3>
<p>There are several ways to locate experiments one may be interested in including
in the data set, but we'll simply look at the current list of experiments and
choose the ones we wish.</p>

<pre>
<strong>$ all_entities_ExperimentMeta -f "title"</strong>
kb|expm.2	Shewanella mutant motility fitness
kb|expm.12	Shewanella matched fitness/expression experiments in a variety of
conditions, Arkin 2013
kb|expm.5	Shewanella mutant carbon fitness
kb|expm.1	Shewanella mutant heat, cold, and population stress fitness
kb|expm.0	Shewanella mutant anaerobic fitness
kb|expm.6	Shewanella mutant temperature fitness
kb|expm.11	Shewanella mutant and WT growth curves
kb|expm.9	Shewanella mutant nitrogen fitness
kb|expm.3	Shewanella mutant carbon and nitrogen fitness
kb|expm.13	Shewanella MR-1 growth curves and growth calls on various carbon 
sources, Arkin 2013
kb|expm.4	Shewanella mutant chemical stress condition fitness
kb|expm.7	Shewanella mutant sulfur fitness
kb|expm.8	Shewanella mutant phosphorous fitness
kb|expm.10	Shewanella mutant pH fitness
<strong>$ echo 'kb|expm.7' | get_entity_ExperimentMeta 
-f "title,description,comments"</strong>
kb|expm.7	Shewanella mutant sulfur fitness	Fitness experiments on 
Shewanella MR-1 strains with gene disruptions in various environments varying 
the sulfur source in shewanella minimal medium.
</pre>

<p>
Here, we simply pulled a list of experiment titles from the CDS and then got a
bit more information about the experiment we're interested in.</p>

<p>Now let's figure out which microarrays we wish to use from that experiment.
</p>

<pre>
<strong>$echo 'kb|expm.7' | get_relationship_HasExperimentalUnit -to id | 
cut -f2 | get_relationship_GroupedBy -to "id,name,comments,groupType" | 
cut -f2- | uniq</strong>
kb|expug.103	Arkin shewanella 2011 chip 146: hypotaurine		microarray
kb|expug.102	Arkin shewanella 2011 chip 147: thiourea		microarray
kb|expug.230	Arkin shewanella 2011 chip 148: thiosulfate		microarray
kb|expug.210	Arkin shewanella 2011 chip 149: cysteine		microarray
kb|expug.75	Arkin shewanella 2011 chip 150: sulfate		microarray
kb|expug.76	Arkin shewanella 2011 chip 151: sulfite		microarray
kb|expug.77	Arkin shewanella 2011 chip 152: glutathione		microarray
kb|expug.78	Arkin shewanella 2011 chip 153: thiophosphate		microarray
</pre>

<p>Let's exclude thiosulfate from the list. It's smelly.</p>

<h3>Setting up the workspace</h3>

<p>Next we need to set up a workspace to store our growmatch data.</p>

<pre>
<strong>$ ws-login experimenttest</strong>
Password: **********
Login successful. Now logged in as:
experimenttest
<strong>$ ws-createws expt_tutorial n</strong>
Workspace created with name:
expt_tutorial
</pre>

<h3>Extracting the data from the CDS</h3>

<p>Now we're ready to pull the data. We happen to know that the genome id for 
Shewanella MR-1 is kb|g.20848.</br> 
Keep in mind there are many more options for including and excluding data than 
are noted here - run the script with the --help option for more information.<p>

<pre>
<strong>$ exp_find_growmatch_data -g 'kb|g.20848' -w expt_tutorial 
-o my_growmatch_pre --experimentMetaIDs 'kb|expm.7' 
--exclude-groups 'kb|expug.230'</strong></pre>

<h3>Verify generation</h3>

<p>Now we can check that the data was stored in the workspace.</p>

<pre>
<strong>$ ws-getmeta 'Growmatch data' my_growmatch_pre -w expt_tutorial</strong>
Object ID: my_growmatch_pre
Type: Growmatch data
Workspace: expt_tutorial
Owner: experimenttest
Instance: 0
Moddate: 2013-02-01T19:31:36
Last cmd: storeGrowmatchInput
Modified by: experimenttest
Perm ref: 75C79364-6CA2-11E2-9020-B291C6D72645
Object metadata retrieved:
1
</pre>

<p>Actually getting the object is not useful for a non-programmer as it's very 
large and is not simple to understand. Instead, thie object should be 
thresholded, typically manually, and then formatted into a PhenotypeSet object.
A future tutorial will cover this topic.</p>
