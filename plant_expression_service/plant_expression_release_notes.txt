OVERVIEW
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The plant expression service provides gene expression retrieval service in support of the co-expression network and ontology driven data needs of the plant sciences community. Currently, the processed data is Arabidopsis thaliana microarray gene expression experiments from NCBI GEO and consists of 7000 samples. This data will be used for co-expression analysis tools, included in scripts directory. 

It will serve queries for tissue and condition specific gene expression co-expression network for biologically interesting genes/samples. The samples of these experiments are manually annotated using plant ontology (PO) [http://www.plantontology.org/] and environment ontology (EO) [http://obo.cvs.sourceforge.net/viewvc/obo/obo/ontology/phenotype/environment/environment_ontology.obo] controlled vocabularies. Users can search differentially expressed genes in different tissues (e.g root or shoot etc.) or in different experimental conditions/treatments (e.g various biotic or abiotic stresses etc.). Currently the metadata annotation is provided for a subset of gene expression experiments from the NCBI GEO microarray experiments.
