<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>This tutorial will help you install kbase.app and work directly with KBase
tools at an interactive shell prompt. </p>
<p>The easiest way to get started with the KBase tools in this manner
is to use the downloadable Mac application bundle for the KBase. The
application bundle contains an installation of the KBase toolkit and
the runtime support code required for the toolkit. It also contains
tools for creating a local development environment and for bundling a
development environment into a new application bundle, thus enabling
users to redistribute the KBase toolkit with additional functionality.
Tools developed in this environment are additionally candidates for
easy integration into the official KBase software releases and the
publicly accessible IRIS site.
</p>
<h2>Installing the KBase Application Bundle</h2>
<p>The KBase application bundle is available for download at the KBase
tools site:
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="http://kbase.us/developer-zone/downloads/" target="_blank" title="KBase download site">http://kbase.us/developer-zone/downloads/</a>
</p>
<p>Click on the link next to "Mac OS X package" and save the file to your
computer.</p>
<p><img alt="Mac downloads list." src="kbmac_dl_list.png" style="width: 428px; height: 231px;"></p>
<p>Double-click the downloaded file; you should see
a window open with the KBase application in it:

</p>
<a name="gatekeeper">
<p>
<b>Note</b></a>: recent versions of MacOS X (Mountain Lion) have a feature
called Gatekeeper, which protects
you from inadvertently installing malware on your Mac. If you have
Gatekeeper, then when you double-click the DMG, you may get an error
message that says that the file is damged and can't be opened.
</p><p><a target="_new"
href="http://kb.wordpress.depauw.edu/?page_id=3195">This page</a>
explains how to temporarily disable Gatekeeper so that you can install
unsigned applications like the KBase DMG. After following those
instructions, double-click the DMG again.
</p>
<p align="left">To install the application into your Applications
folder, just drag the KBase icon onto the Applications icon. You will
then see a status window:
<br>
</p>
<p align="left"><img alt="Copying the data." src="kbmac_copying.png" style="width: 407px; height: 101px;"></p>
<p align="left">The application will be installed on your
computer. To start it, go to your Applications folder and double-click
the KBase icon. The first time you run it you will see a warning about
a newly downloaded application:
<br>
</p>
<p align="left"><img alt="Internet warning from first run." src="kbmac_app_first_run2.png" style="width: 488px; height: 160px;"></p>
<p align="left">Click "Open." A Terminal.app window will
open and you will be able to run KBase commands there.
<br>

You will now be able to work through any of the KBase <a

terminal shell prompt.</p>
