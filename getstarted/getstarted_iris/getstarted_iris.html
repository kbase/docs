<h1>Getting Started with IRIS</h1>
<p>
IRIS was the first user interface to KBase. IRIS is no longer officially supported. We recommend that you use our newer Narrative user interface instead. This page is provided as an archive for those who still wish to use IRIS. Please note that some of the instructions in the tutorials may not work correctly.
