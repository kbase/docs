<h2>Introduction</h2>
This tutorial is intended to teach developers who are used to working
with MicrobesOnline identifiers how to translate these identifiers
to and from KBase identifiers.

<p>
MicrobesOnline uses "Locus IDs" to refer to loci on
a genome.  MicrobesOnline locus IDs are integers.

<p>
KBase has two objects that correspond to loci: "features" and
"proteins."  A "feature" is an annotated region of a genome, and
feature IDs ("fids") are alphanumeric (e.g., "kb|g.20029.peg.3202").
A "protein" is the protein encoded by a feature, and these identifiers
look like MD5 sums (e.g., "cf87188c893421a9a13c9300b1c3cd68").

<h2>Sample Program to Translate MicrobesOnline Locus IDs to KBase
Feature IDs</h2>

<pre>
#!/usr/bin/perl

use strict;
use Data::Dumper;
use Bio::KBase::MOTranslationService::Client;

my $client=Bio::KBase::MOTranslationService::Client->new("http://localhost:7061");

my $locusId2fids=$client->moLocusIds_to_fids([208945,14382]);
print Dumper($locusId2fids);
</pre>

<p>
The above program assumes that you're running the service locally; if not,
replace "localhost" with the IP address of the machine running the
service.

<p>
The above program should print a hash in which the keys are the
query locus IDs, and the values are arrays of corresponding KBase fids.
Here's sample output (which will change in the future as both
databases change):

<pre>
$VAR1 = {
          '208945' => [
                        'kb|g.20029.peg.2605',
                        'kb|g.2423.peg.755',
                        'kb|g.2424.peg.2967',
                        'kb|g.3562.peg.734'
                      ],
          '14382' => [
                       'kb|g.0.peg.1575',
                       'kb|g.10012.peg.2841',
                       'kb|g.1610.peg.1325',
                       'kb|g.1748.peg.2746',
                       'kb|g.1870.peg.1659'
                     ]
        };
</pre>

<h2>Sample Program to Translate KBase Feature IDs to MicrobesOnline
Locus IDs</h2>

<pre>
#!/usr/bin/perl

use strict;
use Data::Dumper;
use Bio::KBase::MOTranslationService::Client;

my $client=Bio::KBase::MOTranslationService::Client->new("http://localhost:7061");

my $fids2loci=$client->fids_to_moLocusIds(["kb|g.21765.CDS.880", "kb|g.21765.CDS.101"]);
print Dumper($fids2loci);
</pre>

<p>
The above program (with the same caveat regarding the IP address of
the service) should print a hash in which the keys are the query KBase
fids, and the values are arrays of corresponding MicrobesOnline locus
IDs.  Here's sample output (which will change in the future as both
databases change):

<pre>
$VAR1 = {
          'kb|g.21765.CDS.880' => [
                                    '1159002',
                                    '1239177',
                                    '2488271',
                                    '3194105',
                                    '14382',
                                    '5495311',
                                    '5691808',
                                    '6777808',
                                    '7701501'
                                  ],
          'kb|g.21765.CDS.101' => [
                                    '71751',
                                    '91738',
                                    '1154302',
                                    '1149610',
                                    '1159001',
                                    '1239176'
	                          ]
        };
</pre>

<p>
Finally, here's a program to convert between KBase protein IDs and
MicrobesOnline locus IDs.

<p>
<h2>Sample Program to Translate KBase Protein IDs to and from MicrobesOnline
Locus IDs</h2>

<pre>
#!/usr/bin/perl

use strict;
use Data::Dumper;
use Bio::KBase::MOTranslationService::Client;

my $client=Bio::KBase::MOTranslationService::Client->new("http://localhost:7061");

my $loci2prot=$client->moLocusIds_to_proteins([14382]);
print Dumper($loci2prot);

my $prot2loci=$client->proteins_to_moLocusIds(["e465935ff61a153e054214ab25c51637"]);
print Dumper($prot2loci);
</pre>

<p>
The above program (with the same caveat regarding the IP address of
the service) first prints a hash in which the keys are MicrobesOnline
locus IDs, and the values are arrays of corresponding KBase proteins.
It then prints another hash that maps in the reverse direction.  Note
that the mappings are not 1-1, due to the fact that proteins from many
genomes have the same sequence.  Here's sample output (which will
change in the future as both databases change):

<pre>
$VAR1 = {
          '14382' => 'e465935ff61a153e054214ab25c51637'
        };
$VAR1 = {
          'e465935ff61a153e054214ab25c51637' => [
                                                  '1159002',
                                                  '1239177',
                                                  '2488271',
                                                  '3194105',
                                                  '14382',
                                                  '5495311',
                                                  '5691808',
                                                  '6777808',
                                                  '7701501'
                                                ]
        };
</pre>
