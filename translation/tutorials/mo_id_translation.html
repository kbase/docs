<h2>Introduction</h2>
This tutorial is intended to teach developers who are used to working
with Microbes Online identifiers how to translate these identifiers
to and from KBase idenfifiers.
<p>
Microbes Online uses "Locus IDs" to refer to loci on
a genome.  Microbe Online locus ids are integers.
<p>
KBase has two objects that correspond to loci: "features" and
"proteins."  A "feature" is an annotated region of a genome, and
feature ids ("fids") are alphanumeric (e.g., "kb|g.20029.peg.3202").
A "protein" is the protein encoded by a feature, and these identifiers
look like MD5 sums (e.g., "cf87188c893421a9a13c9300b1c3cd68").
<p>
<h2>Sample Program to Translate Microbes Online Locus IDs to KBase Feature IDs</h2>
<pre>
#!/usr/bin/perl

use strict;
use Data::Dumper;
use Bio::KBase::MOTranslationService::Client;

my $client=Bio::KBase::MOTranslationService::Client->new("http://localhost:7061");

my $locusId2fids=$client->moLocusIds_to_fids([208945,7704787]);
warn Dumper($locusId2fids);
</pre>
<p>

The above program assumes that you're running the service locally; if not,
replace "localhost" with the IP address of the machine running the
service.

The above program should return "???" FIXME--could not be tested; produces:
<pre>
Error invoking method moLocusIds_to_fids
HTTP status: 500 Status read failed: Connection reset by peer
