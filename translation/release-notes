The MO translation component of the translation service translates
KBase ids to MicrobesOnline ids and vice-versa.  These methods are
used to retrieve MicrobesOnline annotations (such as orthologs, domains,
and operons) for corresponding KBase objects.

The MO translation service can currently translate between KBase
fids which are proteins (i.e., have MD5s) and MicrobesOnline locusIds.
It has a client API and documentation as part of the typespec.

Future releases should try to include methods to translate other objects
such as contigs, genomes, and/or noncoding fids (e.g., RNAs, CRISPRs).
More tests are also needed.
