<h1>Workspace Command Line Script User Manual</h1>
<h2>Workspace Overview</h2>
<p>Workspaces are used in KBase to provide an online location for all
data, models, and
analysis results. Workspaces are a powerful tool for managing private
data, tracking workflow provenance, storing and sharing large datasets,
and tracking work history. They
have a number of useful characteristics which you will learn about in
this user manual:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Multiple users can read and write from the same workspace at the
same time, facilitating collaboration</li>
  <li>When an object is overwritten in a workspace, the previous
version is preserved and
easily accessible at any time, enabling the use of workspaces to track
object provenance</li>
  <li>Workspaces have default permissions and user-specific
permissions, providing total control over the sharing and access of
workspace contents</li>
</ul>
<p>In the following overviews, we demonstrate all functions of the
KBase workspace.</p>

</div><div><h3>1. Installing and accessing workspace commands</h3>
</a>
<p>The Workspace Command Line tools are available either through the <a href="http://iris.kbase.us" target="_blank">Iris command web interface</a>
or through the
<a href="http://www.kbase.us" target="_blank">KBase Client Installation</a>.
Thus, the first step towards using the workspace commands is to either
familiarize yourself with Iris in the Iris tutorial:
<a href="/for-users/get-started#iris" target="_blank">Iris Overview Tutorial</a>
or to install and run the KBase Client Installation.
<a name="STEP2">
</div><div><h3>2. Viewing available workspaces, switching current workspace, and
listing workspace contents</h3>
</a></p>
<p>This user manual covers the commands used to list available
workspace, switch the
currently selected workspace, and list all objects contained in the
currently selected
workspace. This includes the following specific workspace commands:</p>
<ul>
  <li><code title = "iris-tutorials">kbws-list</code>: lists workspaces accessible by the user</li>
  <li><code title = "iris-tutorials">kbws-workspace</code>: displays and changes currently selected workspace</li>
  <li><code title = "iris-tutorials">kbws-meta</code>: displays the metadata for the currently selected
workspace</li>
  <li><code title = "iris-tutorials">kbws-listobj</code>: lists objects contained in the currently selected
workspace</li>
</ul>

documentation</a>
<a name="STEP3">
</div><div><h3>3. Creating, deleting, and cloning workspaces</h3>
</a>
<p>Now that you can list the available workspaces and view workspace
contents, it's time
to learn how to create and delete your own workspaces. There are three
commands to support
the creation, deletion, and cloning of workspaces:</p>
<ul>
  <li><code title = "iris-tutorials">kbws-createws</code>: creates a new workspace to be owned and managed by
you </li>
  <li><code title = "iris-tutorials">kbws-clone</code>: creates an exact clone of an existing workspace to
enable tinkering </li>
  <li><code title = "iris-tutorials">kbws-deletews</code>: deletes an existing workspace with all objects
(use with caution!!!)</li>
</ul>

documentation</a>
<a name="STEP4">
</div><div><h3>4. Managing workspace permissions</h3>
</a>
<p>Now that you can create your own workspaces, you will want to manage
the permissions
for the access of those workspaces by other users. Any user with
administrative privileges
can manage workspace permissions. The workspace owner has
administrative permissions by
default, but other users can be provided with administrative privileges
if required. There
are three commands to support the management of workspace permissions:</p>
<ul>
  <li><code title = "iris-tutorials">kbws-setglobalperm</code>: resets the global default permissions for all
users for a workspace</li>
  <li><code title = "iris-tutorials">kbws-setuserperm</code>: resets specific permissions for a list of users</li>
  <li><code title = "iris-tutorials">kbws-perm</code>: returns a list of all currently set user-specific
permissions for a workspace</li>
</ul>

documentation</a>
<a name="STEP5">
</div><div><h3>5. Retrieving, altering, and loading workspace objects</h3>
</a>
<p>Now that we can create workspaces and manage their permissions, we
want to start populating our workspace with objects. Workspaces provide
a online location for users to
store and share their data, models, and analysis results. Most KBase
tools operate on
objects in the KBase workspace. There are four commands to support
object retreival, load
and deletion:</p>
<ul>
  <li><code title = "iris-tutorials">kbws-get</code>: enables the retrieval of object data from the workspace</li>
  <li><code title = "iris-tutorials">kbws-getmeta</code>: enables the retrieval of object metadata from the
workspace</li>
  <li><code title = "iris-tutorials">kbws-exists</code>: checks if an object exists in a workspace</li>
  <li><code title = "iris-tutorials">kbws-load</code>: enables new objects to be loaded into a workspace</li>
  <li><code title = "iris-tutorials">kbws-delete</code>: enables the deletion of workspace objects</li>
</ul>

command documentation</a>
<a name="STEP6">
</div><div><h3>6. Viewing object history and reverting objects</h3>
</a>
<p>Now that you can create and manage the objects in your workspace,
you will want to learn about the workspace features that support object
provenance. When an object in a workspace is overwritten, the old
version of the object is not lost. It is conserved, and a history of
previous
versions of all workspace objects is maintained. At any time, you can
retrieve any previous version of an object, and you can revert the
current instance of an
object to any of its previous versions. There are three commands in the
workspace that
provide support for object history:</p>
<ul>
  <li><code title = "iris-tutorials">kbws-history</code>: retrieves the metadata for all previous versions of
an object</li>
  <li><code title = "iris-tutorials">kbws-revert</code>: reverts the current instance of an object to a
previous version</li>
  <li><code title = "iris-tutorials">kbws-get</code>: enables the user to retrieve the current and all
previous versions of an object</li>
</ul>

documentation</a>
<a name="STEP7">
</div><div><h3>7. Copying and moving workspace objects</h3>
</a>
<p>Now that you understand how to create, retrieve, and revert
workspace object, you will
want to learn how to copy and move workspace objects. The workspaces
allow you to copy any
object you have read access to, and you can move any object you have
write access to. There
are two commands to support object copying and moving:</p>
<ul>
  <li><code title = "iris-tutorials">kbws-copy</code>: copies an object from one workspace and ID to another</li>
  <li><code title = "iris-tutorials">kbws-move</code>: moves an object from one workspace and ID to another</li>
</ul>
<a href="ObjectMovement.html" target="_blank">Detailed command
documentation</a>
<a name="STEP8">
</div><div><h3>8. Managing object types in the workspace</h3>
</a>
<p>All objects stored in a KBase workspace are typed (e.g., Genome,
FBAModel), and a recognizable type must be provided for all objects
loaded into a workspace. You can see the list of types currently
accepted by the workspace, and commands are provided to enable the
addition of new types as
needed by users. There are three commands to support the management of
workspace types:</p>
<ul>
  <li><code title = "iris-tutorials">kbws-types</code>: retrieves a list of all types currently recognized by
the workspace</li>
  <li><code title = "iris-tutorials">kbws-addtype</code>: adds a new recognizable type to the workspace</li>
  <li><code title = "iris-tutorials">kbws-removetype</code>: removes a user-added type from the list of
recognized types</li>
</ul>

documentation</a>
<a name="STEP9">
</div><div><h3>9. Accessing outstanding jobs</h3>
</a>
<p>Lastly, the workspace provides commands to manage jobs submitted by
the user to run on
KBase cluster resources.</p>
<ul>
  <li><code title = "iris-tutorials">kbws-jobs</code>: retrieves a list of jobs submitted by the user to the
workspace</li>
</ul>
