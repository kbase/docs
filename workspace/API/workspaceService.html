   SYNOPSIS
  </h2>
  <p>
   Workspaces are used in KBase to provide an online location for all data, models, and analysis results. Workspaces are a powerful tool for managing private data, tracking workflow provenance, storing and sharing large datasets, and tracking work history. They have a number of useful characteristics which you will learn about over the course of the workspace tutorials:
  </p>
  <p>
   1.) Multiple users can read and write from the same workspace at the same time, facilitating collaboration
  </p>
  <p>
   2.) When an object is overwritten in a workspace, the previous version is preserved and easily accessible at any time, enabling the use of workspaces to track object provenance
  </p>
  <p>
   3.) Workspaces have default permissions and user-specific permissions, providing total control over the sharing and access of workspace contents
  </p>
  <h2 id="EXAMPLE-OF-API-USE-IN-PERL">
   EXAMPLE OF API USE IN PERL
  </h2>
  <p>
   To use the API, first you need to instantiate a workspace client object:
  </p>
  <p>
   my $client = Bio::KBase::workspaceService::Client-&gt;new;
  </p>
  <p>
   Next, you can run API commands on the client object:
  </p>
  <p>
   my $ws = $client-&gt;create_workspace({ workspace =&gt; &quot;foo&quot;, default_permission =&gt; &quot;n&quot; }); my $objs = $client-&gt;list_workspace_objects({ workspace =&gt; &quot;foo&quot; }); print map { $_-&gt;[0] } @$objs;
  </p>
  <h2 id="AUTHENTICATION">
   AUTHENTICATION
  </h2>
  <p>
   Each and every function in this service takes a hash reference as its single argument. This hash reference may contain a key
   <code>
    auth
   </code>
   whose value is a bearer token for the user making the request. If this is not provided a default user &quot;public&quot; is assumed.
  </p>
  <h2 id="WORKSPACE">
   WORKSPACE
  </h2>
  <p>
   A workspace is a named collection of objects owned by a specific user, that may be viewable or editable by other users.Functions that operate on workspaces take a
   <code>
    workspace_id
   </code>
   , which is an alphanumeric string that uniquely identifies a workspace among all workspaces.
