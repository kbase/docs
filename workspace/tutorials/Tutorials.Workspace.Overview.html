<h1>Workspace Command Line Script Tutorials</h1>

<h2>Workspace Overview</h2>

<p>Workspaces are used in KBase to provide an online location for all data, models, and
analysis results. Workspaces are a powerful tool for managing private data, tracking 
workflow provenance, storing and sharing large datasets, and tracking work history. They
have a number of useful characteristics which you will learn about over the course of the
workspace tutorials:</p>
<ul>
<li>Multiple users can read and write from the same workspace at the same time, 
facilitating collaboration</li>
<li>When an object is overwritten in a workspace, the previous version is preserved and
easily accessible at any time, enabling the use of workspaces to track object provenance</li>
<li>Workspaces have default permissions and user-specific permissions, providing total 
control over the sharing and access of workspace contents</li>
</ul>

<p>In the following overview tutorials, we demonstrate all functions of the KBase 
workspace.</p>

<a name="STEP1"><h3>1. Installing and accessing workspace commands</h3></a>

<p>The Workspace Command Line tools are available either through the <a
href="http://iris.kbase.us" target="_blank">IRIS command web interface</a> or through the
<a href="http://www.kbase.us" target="_blank">KBase Client Installation</a>. Thus, the 
first step towards using the workspace commands is to either familiarize yourself with 
IRIS in the IRIS tutorial:

<a href="Tutorials.IRIS.Overview" target="_blank">IRIS Overview Tutorial</a>

Or to install and run the KBase Client Installation, which is covered in the KBase Client 
tutorial:

<a name="STEP2"><h3>2. Viewing available workspaces, switching current workspace, and 
listing workspace contents</h3></a>
<p>This sub-tutorial covers the commands used to list available workspace, switch the
currently selected workspace, and list all objects contained in the currently selected
workspace. This includes the following specific workspace commands:</p>

<ul>
<li>kbws-list: lists workspaces accessible by the user</li>
<li>kbws-workspace: displays and changes currently selected workspace</li>
<li>kbws-meta: displays the metadata for the currently selected workspace</li>
<li>kbws-listobj: lists objects contained in the currently selected workspace</li>
</ul>

<a name="STEP3"><h3>3. Creating, deleting, and cloning workspaces</h3></a>
<p>Now that you can list the available workspaces and view workspace contents, it's time
to learn how to create and delete you own workspaces. There are three commands to support
the creation, deletion, and cloning of workspaces:</p>

<ul>
<li>kbws-createws: creates a new workspace to be owned and managed by you </li>
<li>kbws-clone: creates an exact clone of an existing workspace to enable tinkering </li>
<li>kbws-deletews: deletes an existing workspace with all objects (use with caution!!!)</li>
</ul>

<a name="STEP4"><h3>4. Managing workspace permissions</h3></a>
<p>Now that you can create your own workspaces, you will want to manage the permissions
for the access of those workspaces by other users. Any user with administrative privileges
can manage workspace permissions. The workspace owner has administrative permissions by
default, but other users can be provided with administrative privileges if required. There
are three commands to support the management of workspace permissions:</p>

<ul>
<li>kbws-setglobalperm: resets the global default permissions for all users for a workspace</li>
<li>kbws-setuserperm: resets specific permissions for a list of users</li>
<li>kbws-perm: returns a list of all currently set user-specific permissions for a workspace</li>
</ul>

<a name="STEP5"><h3>5. Retrieving, altering, and loading workspace objects</h3></a>
<p>Now that we can create workspaces and manage their permissions, we want to start 
populating our workspace with objects. Workspaces provide a online location for users to
store and share their data, models, and analysis results. Most KBase tools operate on
objects in the KBase workspace. There are four commands to support object retreival, load
and deletion:</p>

<ul>
<li>kbws-get: enables the retrieval of object data from the workspace</li>
<li>kbws-getmeta: enables the retrieval of object metadata from the workspace</li>
<li>kbws-exists: checks if an object exists in a workspace</li>
<li>kbws-load: enables new objects to be loaded into a workspace</li>
<li>kbws-delete: enables the deletion of workspace objects</li>
</ul>

<a name="STEP6"><h3>6. Viewing object history and reverting objects</h3></a>
<p>Now that you can create and manage the objects in your workspace, you will want to 
learn about the workspace features that support object provenance. When an object in a 
workspace is overwritten, the old version of the is not lost. It is conserved, and a 
history of previous versions of all workspace objects is maintained. At any time, you can
retrieve any previous version of an object, and you can revert the current instance of an
object to any of its previous versions. There are three commands in the workspace that
provide support for object history:</p>

<ul>
<li>kbws-history: retrieves the metadata for all previous versions of an object</li>
<li>kbws-revert: reverts the current instance of an object to a previous version</li>
<li>kbws-get: enables the user to retrieve the current and all previous versions of an object</li>
</ul>

<a name="STEP7"><h3>7. Copying and moving workspace objects</h3></a>
<p>Now that you understand how to create, retrieve, and revert workspace object, you will
want to learn how to copy and move workspace objects. The workspaces allow you to copy any
object you have read access to, and you can move any object you have write access to. There
are two commands to support object copying and moving:</p>

<ul>
<li>kbws-copy: copies an object from one workspace and ID to another</li>
<li>kbws-move: moves an object from one workspace and ID to another</li>
</ul>

<a name="STEP8"><h3>8. Managing object types in the workspace</h3></a>
<p>All objects stored in a KBase workspace are typed (e.g. Genome, FBAModel), and a recognizable type must be 
provided for all objects loaded into a workspace. You can see the list of types currently
accepted by the workspace, and commands are provided to enable the addition of new types as
needed by users. There are three commands to support the management of workspace types:</p>

<ul>
<li>kbws-types: retrieves a list of all types currently recognized by the workspace</li>
<li>kbws-addtype: adds a new recognizable type to the workspace</li>
<li>kbws-removetype: removes a user-added type from the list of recognized types</li>
</ul>

<a name="STEP9"><h3>9. Accessing outstanding jobs</h3></a>
<p>Lastly, the workspace provides commands to manage jobs submitted by the user to run on
KBase cluster resources.</p>

<ul>
<li>kbws-jobs: retrieves a list of jobs submitted by the user to the workspace</li>
</ul>
