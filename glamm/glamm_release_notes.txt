The KBase GLAMM service is an interactive web application for viewing metabolic maps and overlaying data on top of them. It currently includes support for expression and fitness data, metabolic modeling (flux balance analysis) data, and regulatory information.

The main functions of GLAMM are:
 - Visualize global metabolic maps
 - Visualize organism specific maps
 - Overlay experimental data onto reactions and compounds in the map in a context-dependent manner
 - Overlay information from RegPrecise and other services that lump reaction and compound information into named sets
 - Load and display KBase metabolic models and related data (flux balance analysis results, etc.)


NOVEMBER 2012 RELEASE
---------------------
New additions:
 - Authentication. A user can log in now using their KBase (GlobusOnline) ID, and GLAMM retrieves and stores an Auth Token for the duration of the session.
 - Metabolic Models. The metabolic modeling UI widgets are present, but currently unconnected to the KBase services for loading models.

Coming in the next release:
 - URL API - a specific API for loading up a specific set of views using the URL is under development and will be released in the next build. This will include a mechanism for automatically loading:
 	- a model view
 	- an organism view
 	- RegPrecise regulons/regulog view
 	- a prezoomed region
 	- experimental data view.
