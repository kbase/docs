OVERVIEW
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This module provides services for the evaluation of reliability of cross-species biological network projection to assess gene conservation. Projection of network or a group of genes as a functional module (for simplicity, below we refer them as network) is based on gene orthology and it translates the biological relationships (edges) of genes (nodes) and node attributes from one species to another. But if the genes were randomly distributed in phylogeny, projection of their biological relationships across species would be less reliable. The co-occurrence of genes on phylogenetic tree is a premise before network projection, and therefore, a set of confidence values of gene co-occurrence are output of this module. First, this module creates an evolutionary profile {x0, x1...xn} describing the conservation of a biological network among n species, where xi is percentage of member genes of this network present in species i. With this profile, correlation between network and phylogenetic tree of the n species is calculated using the K statistic. Significant K suggests this network is not randomly distributed on phylogenetic tree. In addition, MPD and MNTD Z-scores are calculated. The two values describe how the network preserves through evolution. Significant MPD Z-score means member genes are clustered through evolution-- i.e., significant association between phylogeny co-occurrence and pre-computed biological relationships among these genes, so that projection of this network is more reliable. Significant MNTD Z-score also supports projected biological relationships between genes. It is different from MPD Z-score in that it suggests the group of genes subject to co-horizontal transfer or very species-specific.
