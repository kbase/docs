      <Notes>
Annotators attach publications to ProteinSequences.  The criteria we have used
to gather such connections is a bit nonstandard.  We have sought to attach publications
to ProteinSequences when the publication includes an expert asserting a belief or estimate
of function.  The paper may not be the original characterization.  Further, it may not
even discuss a sequence protein (much of the literature is very valuable, but reports
work on proteins in strains that have not yet been sequenced).  On the other hand,
reports of sequencing regions of a chromosome (with no specific assertion of a
clear function) should not be attached.  The attached publications give an ID (usually a
Pubmed ID),  a URL to the paper (when we have it), and a title (when we have it).

Each subsystem may include the designation of distinct variants.  Thus,
there may be three closely-related, but distinguishable forms of histidine
degradation.  Each form would be called a "variant", with an associated code,

We use the concept of ProteinSequence as an amino acid string with an associated
MD5 value.  It is easy to access the set of Features that relate to a ProteinSequence.
While function is still associated with Features (and may be for some time), publications
are associated with ProteinSequences (and the inferred impact on Features is through
the relationship connecting ProteinSequences to Features).

      <Notes>

The Kbase will support the maintenance of protein families (as sets of Features
with associated translations).  We are initially only supporting the notion of a family
as composed of a set of isofunctional homologs.  That is, the families we
initially support should be thought of as containing protein-encoding genes whose
associated sequences all implement the same function
(we do understand that the notion of "function" is somewhat ambiguous, so let
us sweep this under the rug by calling a functional role a "primitive concept").

We currently support families in which the members are
translations of features, and we think of Features as
having an associated function. Identical protein sequences
as products of translating distinct genes may or may not
have identical functions, and we allow multiple members of
the same Family to share identical protein sequences.  This
may be justified, since in a very, very, very few cases
identical proteins do, in fact, have distinct functions.
We would prefer to reach the point where our Families are
sets of protein sequence, rather than sets of
protein-encoding Features.

An SSRow (that is, a row in a subsystem spreadsheet) represents a collection of
functional roles present in the Features of a single Genome.  The roles are part
of a designated subsystem, and the fids associated with each role are included in the row,

That is, a row amounts to an instance of a subsystem as it exists in a specific, designated
genome.

      <Asides>It is possible for a single subsystem to occur multiple times

The Kbase houses a large and growing set of genomes.  We often have multiple
genomes that have identical DNA.  These usually have distinct gene calls and
annotations, but not always.  We consider the Kbase to be a framework for
managing hundreds of thousands of genomes and offering the tools needed to
support compartive analysis on large sets of genomes, some of which are
virtually identical.

Each genome has an MD5 value computed from the DNA that is associated with the genome.
Hence, it is easy to recognize when you have identical genomes, perhaps annotated
by distinct groups.

A contig is thought of as composing a part of the DNA associated with a specific
genome.  It is represented as an ID (including the genome ID) and a ContigSequence.
We do not think of strings of DNA from, say, a metgenomic sample as "contigs",
since there is no associated genome (these would be considered ContigSequences).
This use of the term "ContigSequence", rather than just "DNA sequence", may turn out
to be a bad idea.  For now, you should just realize that a Contig has an associated
genome, but a ContigSequence does not.

ContigSequences are strings of DNA.  Contigs have an associated
genome, but ContigSequences do not..   We can think of random samples of DNA as a set of ContigSequences.
There are no length constraints imposed on ContigSequences -- they can be either
very short or very long.  The basic unit of data that is moved to/from the database
is the ContigChunk, from which ContigSequences are formed. The key
of a ContigSequence is the sequence's MD5 identifier.

      <Notes>

ContigChunks are strings of DNA thought of as being a string in a 4-character alphabet
with an associated ID.  We allow a broader alphabet that includes U (for RNA) and
the standard ambiguity characters.

The notion of ContigChunk was introduced to avoid transferring/manipulating
huge contigs to access small substrings.  A ContigSequence is formed by
concatenating a set of one or more ContigChunks.  Thus, ContigChunks are the
basic units moved from the database to memory.  Their existence should be
hidden from users in most circumstances (users are expected to request
substrings of ContigSequences, and the Kbase software locates the appropriate
ContigChunks).

      </Notes>
      <Asides>The maximum length of a chunk is one million bases.
      The key is the contigID followed by a 7-digit ordinal number. So,
      the first sequence will have an ordinal of 0000000 and contain the base
      pairs from position 1 to position 1,000,000, the second will have an
      ordinal of 0000001 and contain the pairs from position 1,000,001 to
      2,000,000, and so forth. This will allow us to store 10 trillion

A PairSet is a precompute set of pairs or genes.  Each pair occurs close to
one another of the chromosome.  We believe that all of the first members
of the pairs correspond to one another (are quite similar), as do all of
the second members of the pairs.  These pairs (from prokaryotic genomes)
offer on of the most powerful clues relating to uncharacterized genes/peroteins.

      <Asides>The pairings for a particular evidence set will contain
      protein sequences that are significantly similar. In other words, if
      (A,B) and (X,Y) are both pairings in a single evidence set, then (A
      =~ X) and (B =~ Y) or (A =~ Y) and (B =~ X), depending on the value
      of the "inverted" attribute of the IsDeterminedBy relationship.
      Essentially, a pairing in its own right is unordered. If (A,B) is a
      pair, then so is (B,A). However, the evidence set maintains a
      correspondence between its pairs that _is_ ordered, because the
      constituent pairs must match. The direction in which a pair matches

A feature (sometimes also called a gene) is a part of a
genome that is of special interest. Features may be spread across
multiple DNA sequences (contigs) of a genome, but never across more
than one genome. Each feature in the database has a unique
ID that functions as its ID in this table.
Normally a Feature is just a single contigous region on a contig.
Features have types, and an appropriate choice of available types
allows the support of protein-encoding genes, exons, RNA genes,
binding sites, pathogenicity islands, or whatever.

      <Notes>

An atomic regulon is an indivisible group of coregulated features
on a single genome. Atomic regulons are constructed so that a given feature
can only belong to one. Because of this, the expression levels for
atomic regulons represent in some sense the state of a cell.

An atomicRegulon is a set of protein-encoding genes that
are believed to have identical expression profiles (i.e.,
they will all be expressed or none will be expressed in the
vast majority of conditions).  These are sometimes referred
to as "atomic regulons".  Note that there are more common
notions of "coregulated set of genes" based on the notion
that a single regulatory mechanism impacts an entire set of
genes. Since multiple other mechanisms may impact
overlapping sets, the genes impacted by a regulatory
mechanism need not all share the same expression profile.
We use a distinct notion (CoregulatedSet) to reference sets
of genes impacted by a single regulatory mechanism (i.e.,
by a single transcription regulator).

An alignment arranges a group of protein sequences so that they

The actual tree and alignment FASTA are stored in separate flat files.

The Kbase will maintain a set of alignments and associated
trees.  The majority
of these will be based on protein sequences.  We will not have a comprehensive set
but we will have tens of thousands of such alignments, and we view them as an
imporant resource to support annotation.

The alignments/trees will include the tools and parameters used to construct
them.

Access to the underlying sequences and trees in a form convenient to existing
tools will be supported.

      <Notes>A feature is a set of DNA sequence fragments. Most features
      are a single contiquous fragment, so they are located in only one
      DNA sequence; however, fragments have a maximum length, so even a
      single contiguous feature may participate in this relationship
      multiple times. A few features belong to multiple DNA sequences. In
      that case, however, all the DNA sequences belong to the same genome.
      A DNA sequence itself will frequently have thousands of features
      connected to it.</Notes>
