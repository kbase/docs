NAME
    get_expression_samples_data_by_genome_ids

DESCRIPTION
     given a list of Genome IDs, a SampleType ( controlled vocabulary : microarray, RNA-Seq, qPCR, or proteomics) 
     and a int indicating WildTypeOnly (1 = true, 0 = false) , it returns a GenomeExpressionDataSamplesMapping , 
     GenomeId -> StrainId -> ExpressionDataSample. StrainId -> 
        ExpressionSampleDataStructure {genome_id -> {strain_id -> {sample_id -> expressionSampleDataStructure}}}

    Arguments : 
        -genomeID : kbase genome ids.  If have multiple genome ids do the following :  " -genomeID='kb|g.20848'  -genomeID='kb|g.1' "
        -sampleType : the type of sample type to limit results to.  Acceptable values (case ignored): 'microarray', 'RNA-Seq', 'qPCR' or 'proteomics'. 
            Any other passed value will be evaluated to no filter on sample type, thus including all sample types.
        -wildTypeOnly : wildTypeOnly is a flag.  If equal to '1','Y' or 'TRUE' then only strains that are wild type will be included in the results.

    Returns : a genomeExpressionDataSamplesMapping
