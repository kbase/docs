NAME
      pa-calculate -- calculate reaction likelihoods from a probabilistic annotation

SYNOPSIS
      pa-calculate <ProbAnno ID> <RxnProbs ID> [OPTIONS]

DESCRIPTION
      Calculate reaction likelihoods from a probabilistic annotation generated
      by the pa-annotate command.
      
      The results are saved in a RxnProbs typed object and contain putative
      gene annotations (based on a cutoff from the gene most likely to fulfill
      each role associated with the reaction) and likelihood scores.
      
      The RxnProbs object can be used as input to gapfilling a metabolic model
      using the --probrxn option for the kbfba-gapfill command.  However, if 
      you do this you must make sure that the same template model is used for
      gapfilling and for computing probabilities.  If you want to avoid this
      issue, we recommend using the ProbAnno object instead.
      
      Options:
      -e, --showerror       Show any errors in execution
      -h, --help            Display this help message, ignore all arguments
      -o, --overwrite       Overwrite existing RxnProbs object with same name
      --probannows          ID of workspace where ProbAnno object is stored
      -t, --templateid      ID of ModelTemplate object
      -m, --templatews      ID of workspace where ModelTemplate object is stored
      -v, --verbose         Print verbose messages
      -w, --rxnprobsws      ID of workspace where RxnProbs object is saved
