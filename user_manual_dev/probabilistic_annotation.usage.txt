NAME
      pa-url -- update or view url of the probabilistic annotation service endpoint

SYNOPSIS
      pa-url [OPTIONS] [NEW_URL]

DESCRIPTION
      Display or set the URL endpoint for the probabilistic annotation service.
      If run with no arguments or options, then the current URL is displayed.
      If run with a single argument, the current URL will be switched to the
      specified URL.  If the specified URL is named default, then the URL is
      reset to the default production URL.
      
      Options:
      -h, --help         display this help message, ignore all arguments

EXAMPLES
      Display the current URL:
      > pa-url
      Current URL is:
      http://kbase.us/services/probabilistic annotation
      
      Use a new URL:
      > pa-url http://localhost:7073
      Current URL is:
      http://localhost:7073
      
      Reset to the default URL:
      > pa-url default
      Current URL is:

NAME
      pa-annotate -- generate probabilistic annotation for a genome

SYNOPSIS
      pa-annotate <Genome ID> <ProbAnno ID> [OPTIONS]

DESCRIPTION
      Generate alternative annotations for every gene in a genome together
      with their likelihoods.  The current method for calculating likelihoods
      is based on similarity (BLAST) to genes in subsystems and genes with
      literature evidence.
      
      This command takes a significant amount of time to run (since it has to
      run BLAST against a large database), so it is placed on a queue and 
      returns a job ID.  Use the kbws-checkjob command to see if your job has
      finished.  When it is done the results are saved in a ProbAnno typed
      object with the specified ID.
      
      The ProbAnno object can be used as input to gapfilling a metabolic model
      using the --probanno option for the kbfba-gapfill command.
      
      Options:
      -e, --showerror    Show any errors in execution
      --genomews         ID of workspace where Genome object is stored
      -h, --help         Display this help message, ignore all arguments
      -o, --overwrite    Overwrite existing ProbAnno object with same name
      -v, --verbose      Print verbose messages
      -w, --probannows   ID of workspace where ProbAnno object is saved

EXAMPLES
      Generate probabilistic annotation for E. coli K12 genome:
      > pa-annotate kb|g.0.genome kb|g.0.probanno

NAME
      pa-calculate -- calculate reaction likelihoods from a probabilistic annotation

SYNOPSIS
      pa-calculate <ProbAnno ID> <RxnProbs ID> [OPTIONS]

DESCRIPTION
      Calculate reaction likelihoods from a probabilistic annotation generated
      by the pa-annotate command.
      
      The results are saved in a RxnProbs typed object and contain putative
      gene annotations (based on a cutoff from the gene most likely to fulfill
      each role associated with the reaction) and likelihood scores.
      
      The RxnProbs object can be used as input to gapfilling a metabolic model
      using the --probrxn option for the kbfba-gapfill command.  However, if 
      you do this you must make sure that the same template model is used for
      gapfilling and for computing probabilities.  If you want to avoid this
      issue, we recommend using the ProbAnno object instead.
      
      Options:
      -e, --showerror       Show any errors in execution
      -h, --help            Display this help message, ignore all arguments
      -o, --overwrite       Overwrite existing RxnProbs object with same name
      --probannows          ID of workspace where ProbAnno object is stored
      -t, --templateid      ID of ModelTemplate object
      -m, --templatews      ID of workspace where ModelTemplate object is stored
      -v, --verbose         Print verbose messages
      -w, --rxnprobsws      ID of workspace where RxnProbs object is saved
