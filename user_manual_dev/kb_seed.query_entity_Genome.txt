    Limit the results to entities where the given field is LIKE (in the sql sense) the given value.

--op operator,field,value
    Limit the results to entities where the given field is related to
    the given value based on the given operator.

    The operators supported are as follows. We provide text based
    alternatives to the comparison operators so that extra quoting is
    not required to keep the command-line shell from confusing them
    with shell I/O redirection operators.

        < or lt
        > or gt
        <=  or le
        >= or ge
        =
