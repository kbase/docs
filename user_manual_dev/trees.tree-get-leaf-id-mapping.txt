NAME
      tree-get-leaf-id-mapping -- get a mapping from the leaf ids to protein/feature ids

SYNOPSIS
      tree-find-tree-ids [OPTIONS] [TREE_ID]

DESCRIPTION
      Given a tree, this script returns a two column mapping file of internal leaf ids to
      protein sequence or KBase feature IDs.  If the leaf was based on a concatenated sequence,
      this method currently only returns the first sequence ID.  If no canonical feature id
      exists, then none is returned. If a tree ID is not passed in as an argument, then it
      will be read from standard in or an input file.  This method currently only handles one
      tree at a time.  If a list is provided, only the first tree id in the list will be used
                        
      -f, --feature
                        indicate that the IDs should be mapped to feature IDs
                        
      -p, --protein-sequence
                        indicate that the IDs should be mapped to protein sequence IDs

      -i, --input
                        specify input file to read from;  each tree id must
                        be on a separate line in this file
      -h, --help
                        diplay this help message, ignore all arguments
                        
EXAMPLES
      Retrieve a mapping from raw leaf node ids to feature ids
      > tree-get-leaf-id-mapping -f 'kb|tree.1000000'
