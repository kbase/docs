NAME
    mg-annotate-metagenome -- submit a metagenome to be annotated by the
    microbial communities pipeline

VERSION
    1

SYNOPSIS
    mg-annotate-metagenome [-h] [-b bowtie] [-d dereplicate] [-m
    metadata_file_id] [-p KB_password] [-u KB_user] -f sequence_file_id -n
    metagenome_name

DESCRIPTION
    Submit a metagenome to be annotated by the microbial communities
    pipeline. If you are working in IRIS and are authenticated, you do not
    need to enter your KB_user and KB_password.

    NOTE: Currently all submissions are created as public workflows with
    publically viewable data objects. We're currently working to provide an
    authenticated workflow for the submission of private datasets and to
    provide a way for annotations to be loaded into MG-RAST.

    Parameters:

    -f sequence_file_id
            sequence/read file ID in datastore

    -n metagenome_name
            metagenome/file name for sequence file in datastore, must match
            any metagenome name in metadata file

    Options:

    -h      display this help message

    -b bowtie
            switch to declare whether bowtie should be run to screen for
            human sequences (1 or 0, default 1)

    -d dereplicate
            switch to declare whether dereplication should be run (1 or 0,
            default 1)

    -m metadata_file_id
            metadata file ID in datastore

    -p KB_password
            KBase password to authenticate against the API, requires a
            username to be set as well

    -u KB_user
            KBase username to authenticate against the API, requires a
            password to be set as well

    Output:

    KBase ID for your metagenome annotation.
