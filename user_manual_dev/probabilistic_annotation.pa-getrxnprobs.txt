SYNOPSIS
      pa-getrxnprobs [RxnProbs ID] [Workspace]

DESCRIPTION
      Get a table of reaction probabilities from a RxnProbs object.
      Each reaction in the rxnprobs object is given a single row in the output table.
      Reactions with no complexes linked to them will have no rows in the table.
      
      Options:
      -h, --help         display this help message, ignore all arguments

EXAMPLES
      > pa-getrxnprobs 'kb|g.0.rxnprobs' 'MyWorkspace'
