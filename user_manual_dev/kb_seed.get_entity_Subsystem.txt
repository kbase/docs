Usage: get_entity_Subsystem [arguments] < ids > table.with.fields.added

    -c num          Select the identifier from column num
    -i filename     Use filename rather than stdin for input
    --fields list   Choose a set of fields to return. List is a comma-separated list of strings.
    -a		    Return all available fields.
    --show-fields   List the available fields.

The following fields are available:

    version
        version number for the subsystem. This value is incremented each time the subsystem is backed up.
    curator
        name of the person currently in charge of the subsystem
    notes
        descriptive notes about the subsystem
    description
        description of the subsystem's function in the cell
    usable
        TRUE if this is a usable subsystem, else FALSE. An unusable subsystem is one that is experimental or is of such low quality that it can negatively affect analysis.
    private
        TRUE if this is a private subsystem, else FALSE. A private subsystem has valid data, but is not considered ready for general distribution.
    cluster_based
        TRUE if this is a clustering-based subsystem, else FALSE. A clustering-based subsystem is one in which there is functional-coupling evidence that genes belong together, but we do not yet know what they do.
    experimental
        TRUE if this is an experimental subsystem, else FALSE. An experimental subsystem is designed for investigation and is not yet ready to be used in comparative analysis and annotation.
