NAME
    get_expression_samples_data

DESCRIPTION
    core function used by many others. Given a list of KBase SampleIds returns mapping of SampleId to expressionSampleDataStructure 
    (essentially the core Expression Sample Object) : {sample_id -> expressionSampleDataStructure}

    Arguments : 
        -sampleID kbase sample ids.  If have multiple sample ids do the following : " -sampleID='kb|sample.2' -sampleID='kb|sample.3' "

        -h, --help Displays this message and ignores all other arguments   
        -help, --help Displays this message and ignores all other arguments 
        -man, --help Displays this message and ignores all other arguments  
    
    Returns : an ExpressionDataSamplesMap 

    expressionDataSamplesMap = obj->get_expression_samples_data(sampleIDs)
