NAME
      pa-getprobanno -- Get a table of probabilistic annotations

SYNOPSIS
      pa-getprobanno [ProbAnno ID] [Workspace]

DESCRIPTION
      Get a table of annotation probabilities from a ProbAnno object.
      Each gene-annotation pair is given its own row in the table. An annotation is
      a set of roles delimited by '///'.
      
      If -r is specified, gets gene-role pairs instead (the probability of the
      role is computed as the sum of the probabilities of annotations containing it).

      Options:
      -h, --help         display this help message, ignore all arguments
      -r, --roles

EXAMPLES
      > pa-getprobanno 'kb|g.0.probanno'
      gene    annotation   likelihood

      > pa-getprobanno 'kb|g.0.probanno' -r
      gene    role    likelihood
