NAME
      tree-html-add-boxes -- add data values to tree leaves

SYNOPSIS
      tree-html-add-boxes [OPTIONS]

DESCRIPTION
      Modify html tree to include data values for each leaf as a heatmap.  Labels are 
      justified if not already aligned.  Html tree input is taken as STDIN or as a 
      command line arg. Modified tree is STDOUT.

      -d, --data-file
                        Required. Give the path to the data associated with each leaf.  
                        Data file format is tab-delimited, one row per leaf with the 
                        leaf ID as the first column and the data value(s) as the 
                        remaining columns.  Header first line is permitted, but must
                        have '#' in first column, and if present, will be used as 
                        as a key in the legend.  May rerun method with new
                        data file and additional column(s) will be appended.

      -t, --tree-html-file
                        Optional. Give the path to the html tree file, or provide 
                        as STDIN.

      -c, --color-scheme
                        Optional. Configure the color scheme for the heatmap. May 
                        be 'YB' for blue-black-yellow spectrum or 'RYB' for 
                        blue-yellow-red spectrum.
                        
      -h, --help
                        display this help message, ignore all arguments
                        
EXAMPLES
      Add the data from data file 'leaf_data_set1.txt' to html tree file 'tree1.html' using default RYB color scheme
      > cat tree1.html | tree-html-add-boxes -d leaf_data_set1.txt > tree1_with_data1.html
      
      Add the data from data file 'leaf_data_set2.txt' to previous output with color scheme 'YB'
      > tree-html-add_boxes -d leaf_data_set2.txt -t tree1_with_with_data1.html -c YB > tree1_with_data1+2.html
