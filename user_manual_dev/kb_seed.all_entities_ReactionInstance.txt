Usage: all_entities_ReactionInstance [arguments] > entity.data

    --fields list   Choose a set of fields to return. List is a comma-separated list of strings.
    -a		    Return all available fields.
    --show-fields   List the available fields.

The following fields are available:

    direction
        reaction directionality (> for forward, < for backward, = for bidirectional) with respect to this model
    protons
        number of protons produced by this reaction when proceeding in the forward direction. If this is a transport reaction, these protons end up in the reaction instance's main location. If the number is negative, then the protons are consumed by the reaction rather than being produced.
