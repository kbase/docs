Usage: all_entities_Strain [arguments] > entity.data

    --fields list   Choose a set of fields to return. List is a comma-separated list of strings.
    -a		    Return all available fields.
    --show-fields   List the available fields.

The following fields are available:

    name
        The common or laboratory name of the strain, e.g. DH5a or JMP1004.
    description
        A description of the strain, e.g. knockout/modification methods, resulting phenotypes, etc.
    source_id
        The ID of the strain used by the data source.
    aggregateData
        Denotes whether this entity represents a physical strain (False) or aggregate data calculated from one or more strains (True).
    wildtype
        Denotes this strain is presumably identical to the parent genome.
    referenceStrain
        Denotes whether this strain is a reference strain; e.g. it is identical to the genome it's related to (True) or not (False). In contrast to wildtype, a referenceStrain is abstract and does not physically exist and is used for data that refers to a genome but not a particular strain. There should only exist one reference strain per genome and all reference strains are wildtype.
