Usage: get_entity_CodonUsage [arguments] < ids > table.with.fields.added

    -c num          Select the identifier from column num
    -i filename     Use filename rather than stdin for input
    --fields list   Choose a set of fields to return. List is a comma-separated list of strings.
    -a		    Return all available fields.
    --show-fields   List the available fields.

The following fields are available:

    frequencies
        A packed-string representation of the codon usage frequencies. These are not global frequencies, but rather frequenicy of use relative to other codons that produce the same amino acid.
    genetic_code
        Genetic code used for these codons.
    type
        Type of frequency analysis: average, modal, high-expression, or non-native.
    subtype
        Specific nature of the codon usage with respect to the given type, generally indicative of how the frequencies were computed.
