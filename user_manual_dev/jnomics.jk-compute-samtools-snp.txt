Samtools SNP
Run Samtools SNP pipeline on aligned reads
The general workflow includes uploading short reads
to the Cluster. Aligning them with a given Aligner.
The Samtools SNP algorithm can then be called on the output
from the alignment step. The organism reference genome
should be supplied with the -org paramter.
