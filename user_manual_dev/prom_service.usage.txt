NAME
      prom-load-expression-data -- load expression data to a workspace

SYNOPSIS
      prom-load-expression-data [OPTIONS]

DESCRIPTION
      Load gene expression data to a workspace from the CDS.  In the future,
      this method will also support loading data from a file.  Data is saved
      as a set of on/off calls.  See the API specification of the Prom service
      for more details on the format of the expression data.  This method prints
      out the ID of the expression data collection that is created, or 'FAILURE'
      if the data could not be loaded, followed by an error message.  The error
      code is zero if successful, one otherwise. Note that depending on the
      amount of data available in the CDS, this method may take 5 or more minutes
      to complete.  Use the CDM API to determine how much expression data for
      the given genome exists.
      
      -g [GENOME_ID], --genome [GENOME_ID]
                        indicate the genome id of the CDS expression data
                        to load into the current workspace

                        workspace that is configured by the workspace service

                        in addition to the expression data collection ID, which
                        will be on the last line, status messages are displayed; more
                        verbose errors are also displayed, which may be useful for
                        debugging

SYNOPSIS
      prom-change-regulatory-network-namespace [OPTIONS]

DESCRIPTION
      Given a regulatory network saved to a workspace, this script will update
      the gene names in the regulatory network, and save the results as a new
      regulatory network.  It will exit with zero if the method was successful, or
      one if something failed.  The method will return to standard out the new
      ID of the regulatory network that was created in the new namespace.  Run
      with the verbose option to get a log and status message of how many genes
      were mapped and which genes could not be mapped.

                        line where the original gene names are listed in the left
                        column and the cooresponding gene name replacements are
                        listed in the right column.
        
      -w [WORKSPACE_ID], --workspace [WORKSPACE_ID]

NAME
      prom-change-expression-data-namespace -- change gene names in an exp. data

SYNOPSIS
      prom-change-expression-data-namespace [OPTIONS]

DESCRIPTION
      Given an expression data collection saved to a workspace, this script will
      update the gene names in the expression data sets.  Note that unlike
      prom-change-regulatory-network-namespace, this method makes changes in
      place, so that no workspace IDs for the expression data or expression data
      collection will change.  In order to undo the change, the data object
      would need to be reverted.  Also note that if a gene name is not found in
      the mapping, it is ignored and the original name is left in place (thus,
      expression data matricies will retain the same row/col size).  This also
      means that the updated expression data may then have genes in two different
      namespaces if not all genes could be mapped.  Importantly, a side effect is
      that if nothing could be updated, the method will still look like it was
      successful.  Be sure to run with the verbose option to get a log message
      of how many genes could be mapped in each expression data set. This method
      will exit with zero if the method was successful, or one if something failed.
      Run with the verbose option to get a log and status message of how many
      genes were mapped.
      
      -e [EXP_ID], --expression-data [EXP_ID]
                        indicate the id of the expression data collection with
                        which to operate on in the workspace
        
      -m [FILE], --map [FILE]
                        indicate the name of the file that contains the mapping
                        information.  The format of the file should be a two

NAME
      prom-load-regulatory-network -- load a regulatory network to a workspace

SYNOPSIS
      prom-load-regulatory-network [OPTIONS]

DESCRIPTION
      Load a regulatory network to a workspace from the CDS.  In the future,
      this method will also support loading data from a file. See the API
      specification of the Prom service for more details on the format of the
      regulatory network.  This method prints out the ID of the regulatory
      network object that is created, or 'FAILURE' if the data could not be
      loaded, followed by an error message.  The error code is zero if successful,
      one otherwise.  Use the regulation service to determine how much expression
      data for the given genome exists.
      
      -g [GENOME_ID], --genome [GENOME_ID]
                        indicate the genome id of the regulatory network
                        to load into the current workspace
        
      -w [WORKSPACE_ID], --workspace [WORKSPACE_ID]
                        specify the workspace to use.  If left blank, the default
                        workspace that is configured by the workspace service
                        scripts is used
                        
      -v, --verbose
                        in addition to the workspace regulatory network ID, which
                        will be on the last line, status messages are displayed; more
                        verbose errors are also displayed, which may be useful for
                        debugging
                        
      -h, --help

NAME
      prom-create-constraints -- create fba constraints from data

SYNOPSIS
      prom-create-constraints [OPTIONS]

DESCRIPTION
      With a genome object in the workspace, gene expression data in the
      same namespace as the genome, and a regulatory network in the same
      namespace as a genome, you can create a set of FBA model constraints
      that can be used to predict transcription factor knockouts using the
      PROM method (see Chandrasekarana and Price, 2010 PNAS).  This method
      will return the ID of the new PROM model constraints object if
      successful, or an error message if something failed.  This method
      will exit with zero if the method was successful, or one if something
      failed.  Run with the verbose option to get a log and status message
      of the steps involved in the constraints construction.
      
      -g [GENOME_ID], --genome [GENOME_ID]
                        indicate the genome object id of a genome in the
                        workspace to link the constraints to; a genome object
                        can be created with the kbfba-loadgenome script.

      -e [EXP_ID], --expression-data [EXP_ID]
                        indicate the id of the expression data collection with
                        which to use

      -r [REG_NET_ID], --regulatory-network [REG_NET_ID]
                        indicate the id of the regulatory network with which
                        to use
        
      -w [WORKSPACE_ID], --workspace [WORKSPACE_ID]
                        specify the workspace to use.  If left blank, the default
                        workspace that is configured by the workspace service
                        scripts is used

      -v, --verbose
                        in addition to the workspace regulatory network ID, which
                        will be on the last line, status messages are displayed; more
                        verbose errors are also displayed, which may be useful for

      -h, --help
                        diplay this help message, ignore all arguments

EXAMPLES
      Create a PROM model constraints object:
      > prom-create-constraints -g 'kb|g.20848'
