NAME

	coex_filter -- identify highly differeitially expressed genes

SYNOPSIS

	/kb/deployment/rsbin/coex_filter.r [-impnos]

DESCRIPTION

	This function identifies genes that are highly differentially expressed across samples using ANOVA (http://www.maths.bath.ac.uk/~jjf23/book/) 
or Log-odd ratios (http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/2.12/bioc/html/limma.html).
Users can identify the highly differentially expressed across samples either setting up a p-value threshold or choosing the top number.

Input: a table of gene expression data matrix in .csv file

Output: a table of highly differentially expressed genes along with expression value, i.e., mean of replicates per sample in .csv file

Options:
	-i INPUT, --input=INPUT
		REQUIRED: Input file name that stores original gene expression data matrix. Each row corresponds to a gene, and each column corresponds to a replicate. The column names are replicate names. The row names are gene names.

	-m METHOD, --method=METHOD
		Method to identify highly differential expressed genes. Choices include anova and log-odd ratio (lor). [default "lor"]

	-p P_THRESHOLD, --p_threshold=P_THRESHOLD
		Maximum p-value up to which genes significantly highly differentially express [default 0.05]

	-n TOPNUMBER, --topnumber=TOPNUMBER
		Number of top genes that most highly differentially express [default 0]

	-o OUTPUT, --output=OUTPUT
		Output file name that stores gene expression data matrix including selected genes only [default "Gene_expression_data_filtered_for_clustering.csv"]

	-s SAMPLE_INDEX, --sample_index=SAMPLE_INDEX
		RECOMMENDED unless no replicates in data: The file that stores a numeric vector to indicate the sample indices that replicates correspond. For example, if sample_index is equal to c(1,1,2,2,3,3), the first two columns of data correspond to Sample 1, the third and fourth columns correspond to Sample 2, and the fifth and sixth columns correspond to Sample 3. Default is that every two columns correspond to a different sample.

	-u HUMAN, --human=HUMAN
		Accept human input regarding replicates? 'y' to allow, 'n' to automatically use defaults. [y/n]  (Default is 'n')

	-r HAS_REPLICATES, --has_replicates=HAS_REPLICATES
		Does your data have replicates (this helps avoid user input during program runtime)?  [y/n]  (Default is 'y')

	-d DEFAULT_ACTION, --default_action=DEFAULT_ACTION
		Use the default action when dealing with replicates?  [y/n]  (Default is 'y')

	-h, --help
		Show this help message and exit


EXAMPLES 

	$coex_filter -i data.csv –m lor -p 0.01 -s sample_id.csv -o datafilter.csv 

	$coex_filter -i data.csv –m anova -n 200 -s sample_id.csv -o datafilter.csv
