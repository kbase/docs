NAME

	coex_net -- construct gene co-expression network

SYNOPSIS

	/kb/deployment/rsbin/coex_net.r [-imcrkpto]

DESCRIPTION

	For a data matrix that represents gene expressions across samples, this function constructs the gene co-expression network
using correlation matrix or weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA, http://www.genetics.ucla.edu/labs/horvath/CoexpressionNetwork/Rpackages/WGCNA). 

Input: a table of gene expression data matrix in .csv file

Output: edge list or adjacency matrix of gene co-expression network in .csv file

Options:
	-i INPUT, --input=INPUT
		REQUIRED: Input file name that stores the gene expression data matrix that users want to construct gene co-expression network and do clustering. Each row corresponds to a gene, and each column corresponds to a replicate. The column names are replicate names. The row names are gene names.

	-a GENES1, --genes1=GENES1
		The first set of the genes of interest.  Leaving this out means all of the genes will be used.

	-b GENES2, --genes2=GENES2
		The second set of the genes of interest.  Leaving this out means all of the genes will be used.

	-m METHOD, --method=METHOD
		Method to construct gene co-expression network. When method = ‘simple’ or ‘s’, the function constructs gene co-expression network using Pearson correlation matrix whose elements less than corr_thld are set to be zero. When method = “WGCNA” or ‘W’, the function constructs gene co-expression network using Pearson correlations between genes, and “signed” network by WGCNA. [default "simple"]

	-c CORR_THLD, --corr_thld=CORR_THLD
		Maximum threshold to set elements of Pearson correlation matrix to be zero when method=’simple’. [default 0.75]

	-q P_THLD, --p_thld=P_THLD
		Maximum threshold for p from Pearson correlation when method=’simple’. [default NULL]

	-r MINRSQ, --minRsq=MINRSQ
		Minimum threshold for R2 that measures the fitness of gene co-expression network to scale-free topology in WGCNA. See pickSoftThreshold() of WGCNA for details. [default 0.8]

	-k MAXMEDIANK, --maxmediank=MAXMEDIANK
		Maximum median connections for genes in network. See pickSoftThreshold() of WGCNA for details. [default 40]

	-p MAXPOWER, --maxpower=MAXPOWER
		Maximum power to decide the soft threshold. See pickSoftThreshold() of WGCNA for details. [default 50]

	-t TYPE, --type=TYPE
		Type of output. When method = ‘edge’ or ‘e’, the function outputs edge list of gene co-expression network consisting of gene pairs with Pearson correlation greater than corr_thld. When method = “adjmat” or ‘a’, the function outputs the adjacency matrix of constructed gene co-expression network. [default "edge"]

	-o OUTPUT, --output=OUTPUT
		Output file name. [default "coexpression_network.csv"]

	-h, --help
		Show this help message and exit
