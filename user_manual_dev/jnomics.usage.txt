Samtools SNP
Run Samtools SNP pipeline on aligned reads
The general workflow includes uploading short reads
to the Cluster. Aligning them with a given Aligner.
The Samtools SNP algorithm can then be called on the output
from the alignment step. The organism reference genome
should be supplied with the -org paramter.

The Variation pipelines are run in parallel.
When they complete, many VCF files will be produced that must be merged
This command takes the output from a variation pipeline and metadata from
the alignment operations and produces a merged VCF file.
The output will be a single VCF file in the Cluster's filesystem.
The file can be downloaded with fs -get
