NAME
      pa-annotate -- generate probabilistic annotation for a genome

SYNOPSIS
      pa-annotate <Genome ID> <ProbAnno ID> [OPTIONS]

DESCRIPTION
      Generate alternative annotations for every gene in a genome together
      with their likelihoods.  The current method for calculating likelihoods
      is based on similarity (BLAST) to genes in subsystems and genes with
      literature evidence.
      
      This command takes a significant amount of time to run (since it has to
      run BLAST against a large database), so it is placed on a queue and 
      returns a job ID.  Use the kbws-checkjob command to see if your job has
      finished.  When it is done the results are saved in a ProbAnno typed
      object with the specified ID.
      
      The ProbAnno object can be used as input to gapfilling a metabolic model
      using the --probanno option for the kbfba-gapfill command.
      
      Options:
      -e, --showerror    Show any errors in execution
      --genomews         ID of workspace where Genome object is stored
      -h, --help         Display this help message, ignore all arguments
      -o, --overwrite    Overwrite existing ProbAnno object with same name
      -v, --verbose      Print verbose messages
      -w, --probannows   ID of workspace where ProbAnno object is saved

EXAMPLES
      Generate probabilistic annotation for E. coli K12 genome:
      > pa-annotate kb|g.0.genome kb|g.0.probanno
