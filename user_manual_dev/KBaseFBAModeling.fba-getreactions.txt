	-i --idtype      Type of ID
	-p --pretty      Pretty print output

NAME
     .fba-getreactions - Get reaction information by ID

DESCRIPTION
      This function will get information on one or a list of reactions.
      By default, the list of reactions should be SEED IDs. However,
      KEGG, Name, and other types are accessible by specifying the
      approriate type with --idtype.

      Provided information includes reversibility, estimated Gibbs energy
      of reaction, equation in ModelSEED and human-readable format, and EC numbers.

      Use.fba-getaliassets to get a list of valid ID types.

EXAMPLES
      Get information on 'rxn00001' and pretty-print the results
      >.fba-getreactions -p rxn00001
      
      Get information on reacton 'inorganic diphosphatase' (same reaction as rxn00001)
      >.fba-getreactions -p --idtype name 'inorganic diphosphatase'
