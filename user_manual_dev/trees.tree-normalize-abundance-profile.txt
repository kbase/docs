NAME
      tree-normalize-abundance-profile -- normalize and filter metagenomic sample abundance data

SYNOPSIS
      tree-normalize-abundance-profile [OPTIONS]

DESCRIPTION
      Normalize metagenomic abundance read counts by sum, mean, min, or max of a column or globally,
      take the log of the values, and threshold the data by providing a cutoff value.  These steps always
      occur in this order, but all processing steps are optional, so executing this command multiple times
      on the same data can
      
      The expected input is a tab-delimited file with tree node labels in the first column, sample names in
      the first row, and abundance values in the remaining data matrix.  Note that this is the same format
      as the output produced from tree-compute-abundance-profile.  The output format is identical to the input
      format.  Missing values are acceptable and will not be used in calculations.
      
      Input can be piped to standard in or specified with the -i option.  Output is written to standard out.
      
      -s [SCOPE], --normalization-type [SCOPE]
                        specify the scope of normalization; normalization can either be performed per column
                        (e.g. mean is computed per column) or globally across all the data points; available
                        options are: 'per_column', 'global'; the default option is 'per_column'
      -t [TYPE], --normalization-type [TYPE]
                        specify the method of normalization (ie the normalization factor); available
                        options are 'none', 'total', 'mean', 'max', 'min'; the default value if no
                        value is given is 'none', which performes no normalization
      -p [OPERATION], --normalization-post-process [OPERATION]
                        specify an operation to perform on each data element after values have been
                        normalized; available options are 'none', 'log10', 'log2', 'ln'; the default
                        value is 'none'
      -v [VALUE], --cutoff-value [VALUE]
                        specify a cutoff value to threshold the data AFTER it has been normalized and
                        any specified post-normalization operation has been performed; the cutoff value
                        is a floating-point number; if this option is not provided, then no thresholding
                        is applied
      -r [INTEGER], --cutoff-num-records [INTEGER]
                        specify the maximum number of values to include per column, selecting those N
                        elements in each column that are highest; note that the normalization scope
                        parameter is completely ignored for this operation; the cutoff number must be
                        an integer value; if this option is not provided, all records are preserved
      -i [FILE_NAME], --input [FILE_NAME]  
                        specify an input file to read from; if provided standard-in is ignored
      -h, --help
                        display this help message, ignore all arguments
