Usage: get_entity_Genome [arguments] < ids > table.with.fields.added

    -c num          Select the identifier from column num
    -i filename     Use filename rather than stdin for input
    --fields list   Choose a set of fields to return. List is a comma-separated list of strings.
    -a		    Return all available fields.
    --show-fields   List the available fields.

The following fields are available:

    pegs
        Number of protein encoding genes for this genome.
    rnas
        Number of RNA features found for this organism.
    scientific_name
        Full genus/species/strain name of the genome sequence.
    complete
        TRUE if the genome sequence is complete, else FALSE
    prokaryotic
        TRUE if this is a prokaryotic genome sequence, else FALSE
    dna_size
        Number of base pairs in the genome sequence.
    contigs
        Number of contigs for this genome sequence.
    domain
        Domain for this organism (Archaea, Bacteria, Eukaryota, Virus, Plasmid, or Environmental Sample).
    genetic_code
        Genetic code number used for protein translation on most of this genome sequence's contigs.
    gc_content
        Percent GC content present in the genome sequence's DNA.
    phenotype
        zero or more strings describing phenotypic information about this genome sequence
    md5
        MD5 identifier describing the genome's DNA sequence
    source_id
        identifier assigned to this genome by the original source
