DESCRIPTION
  Get an object with only a subset of the object populated.  The subset is
  specified by providing the path in the object to the sub data requested.

  Syntax of subset path:
    Identify a sub portion of an object by providing the path, delimited by
    a slash (/), to that portion of the object. Thus the path may not have
    slashes in the structure or mapping keys. For this command only, multple
    paths may be given if delimited by a semicolon (;). Examples:
       /foo/bar/3 - specifies the bar key of the foo mapping and the 3rd
                    entry of the array if bar maps to an array or the value mapped to
                    the string "3" if bar maps to a map.
      /foo/bar/[*]/baz - specifies the baz field of all the objects in the
                         list mapped by the bar key in the map foo.
      /foo/*/baz - specifies the baz field of all the objects in the
                   values of the foo mapping.
