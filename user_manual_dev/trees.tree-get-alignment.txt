NAME
      tree-get-alignment -- retrieve alignment or alignment meta data from the CDS

SYNOPSIS
      tree-get-alignment  [OPTIONS] [TREE_ID]

DESCRIPTION
      Retrieve the specified alignment or meta information associated with the alignment.
      The alignment is returned in FASTA format by default with sequence labels in an
      arbitrary internal id that is unique only within the given alignment. To return the
      alignment with node labels replaced with KBase protein sequence IDs or cannonical
      feature IDs, use the options below.  To provide a list of IDs, pipe in the list
      through standard-in or specify an input file to read.  In either case, each alignment
      id should appear on a separate line.  In the case of a list, results are returned
      in the same order they were provided as input.
      
      -p, --protein-sequence
                        set this flag to return the alignment with sequence labels replaced with
                        protein sequence IDs
                        
      -f, --feature
                        set this flag to return the alignment with sequence labels replaced with KBase
                        feature IDs.  Note that some alignments may not have assigned cannonical
                        feature IDs for each node, in which case blank labels will be returned.
                        
      -m, --meta
                        set this flag to return meta data instead of the tree itself
                        
      -i, --input [FILENAME]
                        set this flag to specify the input file to read
                        
      -h, --help
                        diplay this help message, ignore all arguments
                        
                        

EXAMPLES
      Retrieve the raw alignment in FASTA
      > tree-get-alignment 'kb|aln.25'
      
      Retrieve meta data about an alignment
      > tree-get-alignment -m 'kb|aln.25'
