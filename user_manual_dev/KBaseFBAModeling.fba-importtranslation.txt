NAME
     .fba-importtranslation

DESCRIPTION

      Adds aliases to an existing Genome file based on a translation file. This allows the user to
      use those aliases as arguments to other functions that take genes as inputs.

      The translation file is a tab-delimited file with two columns without any header row. The two 
      columns must be in this order:

      alias   feature ID

      Feature ID is the ID of the gene in the Genome object and alias is the alias you wish to add. An
      example translation file could look like this:


      ECOLI_GENE1  kb|g.0.peg.1

EXAMPLES

     .fba-importtranslation 'kb|g.0' 'kb|g.0.translationfile' 'madeup'
