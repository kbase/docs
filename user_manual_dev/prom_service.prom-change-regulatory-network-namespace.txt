NAME
      prom-change-regulatory-network-namespace -- change gene names in a reg. network

SYNOPSIS
      prom-change-regulatory-network-namespace [OPTIONS]

DESCRIPTION
      Given a regulatory network saved to a workspace, this script will update
      the gene names in the regulatory network, and save the results as a new
      regulatory network.  It will exit with zero if the method was successful, or
      one if something failed.  The method will return to standard out the new
      ID of the regulatory network that was created in the new namespace.  Run
      with the verbose option to get a log and status message of how many genes
      were mapped and which genes could not be mapped.
      
      -r [REG_NET_ID], --regulatory-network [REG_NET_ID]
                        indicate the id of the regulatory network with which to
                        operate on in the workspace
        
      -m [FILE], --map [FILE]
                        indicate the name of the file that contains the mapping
                        information.  The format of the file should be a two
                        column, tab-delimited ASCII text file without a header
                        line where the original gene names are listed in the left
                        column and the cooresponding gene name replacements are
                        listed in the right column.
        
      -w [WORKSPACE_ID], --workspace [WORKSPACE_ID]
                        specify the workspace to use.  If left blank, the default
                        workspace that is configured by the workspace service
                        scripts is used
                        
      -v, --verbose
                        in addition to the expression data collection ID, which
                        will be on the last line, status messages are displayed; more
                        verbose errors are also displayed, which may be useful for
                        debugging
                        
      -h, --help
                        diplay this help message, ignore all arguments

EXAMPLES
      Change the regulatory namespace of a network given the map file 'map.txt'
      > head -n5 map.txt
