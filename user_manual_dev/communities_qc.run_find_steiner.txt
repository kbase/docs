Usage: run_find_steiner.pl

Runs qiime-uclust sort, qiime-uclust search, find Stiener on given fasta file
for given number of iterations (or until converges).

Result to out_file:
line 1:  Base pair header (A T C G N X)
line 2+: count for each bp, each position on one line

    --in_file    (string,       required)  fasta file to process
    --out_file   (string,       required)  file for output (score matrix for bin)
    --tmp_dir    (string,       required)  dir to store intermediate results (cleaned at end)
    --log_file   (string,       optional)  file for log data
    --max_iter   (integer,  default = 10)  maximum number of qiime-uclust iterations if no convergence
    --min_conv   (integer,   default = 3)  minimum number of iterations to identify convergence (and stop qiime-uclust)
