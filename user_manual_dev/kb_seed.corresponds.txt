    -a Cutoff
        This requests an abbreviated format in which only two columns are written:
        the projection score and the fid in the target genome.  If this is not
        used 10 column are produced.  The Cutoff specifies a minimum projection score.

    genome1
    genome2

        Input genomes. These are either filenames which are expected to contain genome
        typed-objects (as created by annotate_genome, for instances) or they are
        KBase genome IDs.
