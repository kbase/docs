Communities API Service 

DESCRIPTION
The Communities API offers data retrieval methods for all available microbial communities data. This release contains two new commands:
   
- metagenome      Provides information about single metagenomes or list of available metagenomes.

- analyse_metagenome   Initiates the analysis of an uploaded metagenomic sequence file with metadata.
