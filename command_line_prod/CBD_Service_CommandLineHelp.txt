Compression Based Distance Service

DESCRIPTION
The Compression-based distance Service is a KBase service that 
is a simple, rapid, and accurate method to
efficiently assess differences in microbiota samples.  
CBD characterizes the similarities between microbial communities via the amount of repetition
or overlap in order to determine microbial community distance.  CBD relies on
the fact that more repetitive data is the more it can be compressed.  By
combining 16S rRNA hypervariable tag data from different samples and assessing
the relative amounts of compression, there is a proxy for the similarities
between the communities.  The amount of compression is converted to a distance
by taking compression gained by combining the datasets over the total
compressed size of the individual datasets.  The distance has a value with a
minimum of 0 meaning the communities are the same and a maximum of 1 meaning
the communities are completely different.

NAME
cbd-buildmatrix -- This command will build a distance matrix to compare microbiota samples.

		   The cbd-buildmatrix command will build a distance matrix from a set of sequence files for microbiota
		   comparisons. Compression based distance uses the relative compression of combined and individual 
		   datasets to quantify overlaps between microbial communities.

                ignore all other command-line arguments.

                          The inputPath argument is the path to a file with the list of
                          paths to the input sequence files and the groups each file belongs to.
                          Each line of the list file has two tab delimited fields: 
                          (1) path to a sequence file, (2) list of groups the sequence file belongs to.

EXAMPLES
	Build a distance matrix from the sample1 fasta sequence file includes groups patient1 and day7.

           /myhome/sample1.fasta    patient1;day7

			  after the filter is applied.

group                     The list of group identifiers to apply with the filter (semicolon separated).


EXAMPLES

  	       > cbd-filtermatrix mystudy.input mystudy.csv dest.csv patient1
   
        Filter a distance matrix exclude samples with group patient5:
               > cbd-filtermatrix --filter without
                 mystudy.input mystudy.csv dest.csv patient5
   
        Filter a distance matrix to select samples between groups day0, day7, and day14:
