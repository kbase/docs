Probabilistic Annotation Service

DESCRIPTION
The Probabilistic Annotation service : computes likelihoods for annotations and reactions for a given genome.
Likelihoods are computed based on similarity to genes with literature evidence and genes
in subsystems. More ambiguous role calls are given lower probabilities.



COMMANDS
pa-annotate
pa-calculate
pa-checkjob
pa-getprbanno
pa-getrxprobs
pa-url



NAME
pa-annotate -- This command will generate probabilistic annotation for a genome.

Generate alternative annotations for every gene in a genome together
with their likelihoods.  The current method for calculating likelihoods
is based on similarity (BLAST) to genes in subsystems and genes with
literature evidence.
       
This command takes a significant amount of time to run (since it has to
run BLAST against a large database), so it is placed on a queue and 
returns a job ID.  Use the pa-checkjob command to see if your job has
finished.  When it is done the results are saved in a ProbAnno typed
object with the specified ID.
       
The ProbAnno object can be used as input to gapfilling a metabolic model
using the --probanno option for the fba-gapfill command.

VERSION 1.0.4

SYNOPSIS
pa-annotate <Genome ID> <ProbAnno ID> [OPTIONS]

DESCRIPTION
INPUTS:     The required inputs for this command are the Genome ID and the ProbAnno ID. 
OUTPUTS:    The output for this command is a file containing the probabilistic annotation for the identified genome.


PARAMETERS:
-h, --help           Display help message to standard out and exit with error code zero;
                     ignore all other command-line arguments.

-e, --showerror      Show any errors in execution.
--genomews           ID of workspace where Genome object is stored (default is the current workspace).
-v, --verbose        Print verbose messages.
-w, --probannows     ID of workspace where ProbAnno object is to be saved (default is the current workspace).


EXAMPLES
Generate probabilistic annotation for E. coli K12 genome:
    > pa-annotate kb|g.0.genome kb|g.0.probanno

NAME
pa-calculate -- This command will calculate reaction likelihoods from a probabilistic annotation. 

Calculate reaction likelihoods from a probabilistic annotation generated
by the pa-annotate command.
       
The results are saved in a RxnProbs typed object and contain putative
gene annotations (based on a cutoff from the gene most likely to fulfill
each role associated with the reaction) and likelihood scores.
       
The RxnProbs object can be used as input to gapfilling a metabolic model
using the --probrxn option for the fba-gapfill command.  However, if 
you do this you must make sure that the same template model is used for
gapfilling and for computing probabilities.  If you want to avoid this
issue, we recommend using the ProbAnno object instead.

VERSION 1.0.4

SYNOPSIS
pa-calculate <ProbAnno ID> <RxnProbs ID> [OPTIONS]


DESCRIPTION
INPUTS:     The required inputs for this command are th ProbAnno ID and the RxnProbs ID.
OUTPUTS:    The output for this command is reaction likelihoods from a probabilistic annotation. 


PARAMETERS:
-h, --help           Display help message to standard out and exit with error code zero;
                     ignore all other command-line arguments.
-e, --showerror       Show any errors in execution.
-w, --probannows      ID of workspace where ProbAnno object is stored (default is the current workspace).
-t, --templateid      ID of ModelTemplate object (default is to use all reactions in the biochemistry).
-m, --templatews      ID of workspace where ModelTemplate object is stored.
-v, --verbose         Print verbose messages.
-r, --rxnprobsws      ID of workspace where RxnProbs object is to be saved (default is the current workspace).

NAME
pa-checkjob -- This command will check the status of probabilistic annotation jobs started by pa-annotate command.

Check status of probabilistic annotation jobs submitted by the user.  For
each job, information about the job is displayed.  A job that has completed
is then deleted from the system.

The --jobID optional argument is the identifier of a specific job to check. 
The ujs-url optional argument specifies an alternate URL for the user and
job state service.

VERSION 1.0.4

SYNOPSIS
pa_checkjob [-h] [-jobID ID] [--ujs-url URL]


DESCRIPTION
INPUTS:     The input for this command is the JOB ID. 
OUTPUTS:    The output for this command is the status of the job diplayed in STDOUT.



PARAMETERS:
-h, --help           Display help message to standard out and exit with error code zero;
                     ignore all other command-line arguments.

-j JOBID, --jobID JOBID     The JOB ID of the probabilistic annotation jobs submitted by the user.

--ujs-url URL               The URL for the user and job state service.


EXAMPLES
Check all jobs:
     > pa-checkjob
       
Check a specific job:
     > pa-checkjob --jobID 52b317cbe4b0ef8357331c59

NAME
pa-getprobanno -- This command will get a table of probabilistic annotations.

Get a table of annotation probabilities from a ProbAnno object.
Each gene-annotation pair is given its own row in the table. An annotation is
a set of roles delimited by '///'.
       
If -r is specified, gets gene-role pairs instead (the probability of the
role is computed as the sum of the probabilities of annotations containing it).
VERSION 1.0.4

SYNOPSIS
pa-getprobanno [ProbAnno ID] [Workspace]

INPUTS:     The input for this command is a ProbAnno ID. 
OUTPUTS:    The output for this command is a table of probabilistic annotations.
