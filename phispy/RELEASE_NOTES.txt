OVERVIEW
--------

This KBase service identifies prophages in complete bacterial genomes. PhiSpy
was developed to identify prophages that are located in complete bacterial
genomes, and not to identify partial prophages or phage fragments (e.g. in
metagenomes). The basic idea of PhiSpy is to identify phage specific features
that we can use in machine learning tools to predict other phages. Most of
these require many ORFs and longer stretches of sequence. As you will see in
the PhiSpy paper (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=22584627) some of
the things that work well are our customized AT skew which compares the DNA
composition of the prophage to the neighboring genome sequence, and the number
of consecutive ORFs on the same strand.


The phispy module wraps the PhiSpy code:
