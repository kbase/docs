    <h1>Example Tutorial and Procedure for C5</h1>
    <p>This is an example tutorial to test how to post a new tutorial to the kbase.us website via the C5 Content Management System.</p>
    <p>Please do not make this tutorial &quot;live&quot; or viewable to the public.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Here are some rough notes on how to accomplish this:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Check a tutorial into the git docs repo.<br />
      Log in to C5.<br />
      Go to site map --&gt; add multiple pages (this is a better way than adding a single page)<br />
Select page, then select the parent page<br />
For users<br />
Tutorials &lt;-- click on this<br />
&quot;Left sidebar nag page&quot; &lt;-- this is the template used for tutorials<br />
Enter title in Page Names box<br />
Enter Description in box<br />
Header Extra can be left blank<br />
Meta can be filled in with keywords for searching<br />
Below these, check all boxes to hide the page from navigation for now.<br />
Click Add<br />
The page should now show up in the site map at the bottom of the list of tutorial pages<br />
Open up an example tutorial page that has already been completed.<br />
Use the clipboard. Click on regions of the completed tutorial page, such as the side navigation, title and body sections. For each, select to 	copy to clipboard. It will copy the functionality, not the exact text that you see.<br />
(An alternate way to do this is via &quot;stacks,&quot; but use the clipboard for now.)<br />
Now go to your new tutorial page.<br />
Click &quot;edit.&quot;<br />
Paste the formatting into the blocks from the corresponding sections in the completed tutorial.<br />
Then choose &quot;add block&quot;<br />
Type html, then select the &quot;html file&quot; option that appears.<br />
Type in the correct path to the doc in git docs repo, for example docs/example_service/tutorials/example_tutorial.html (not that there is no 	beginning / forward slash before docs in the path).<br />
The page should populate with content from the tutorial in git doc repo<br />
When you are happy with the new tutorial page, go back into the page properties for your new tutorial page and deselect all of the check boxes to include it in navigation, lists, and search.</p>
