<h2>Viewing, switching, and listing Workspaces</h2>
<p>This user manual covers the commands used to list available workspaces, switch the
currently selected workspace, and list all objects contained in the currently selected
workspace. This includes the following workspace commands:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="#STEP1">kbws-list: lists workspaces accessible by the user</a></li>
<li><a href="#STEP2">kbws-workspace: displays and changes currently selected workspace</a></li>
<li><a href="#STEP3">kbws-meta: displays the metadata for the currently selected workspace</a></li>
<li><a href="#STEP4">kbws-listobj: lists objects contained in the currently selected workspace</a></li>
</ol>
<a name="STEP1"><h3>1. kbws-list</h3></a>
<p>The kbws-list command enables the user to list all the workspaces the user currently 
has at least read permissions for. The following is the usage for this command:</p>
<pre><code><i>
	kbws-list [-?eh] [long options...]
		-e --showerror   Show any errors in execution
		-? -h --help     Print this usage information
</i></pre></code>
<p>Let's see an example of this command in action. We can run the kbws-list command, which
returns the following output:</p>
<pre><code><i>
	$ kbws-list
		ID    Owner  Last Mod            Objects User perm Default perm
		test  chenry 2012-12-26T06:11:50 4       r         r           
		kbase chenry 2012-12-26T22:17:45 4       r         r 
</i></pre></code>
<p>In this output, we see a table of data on the workspaces currently available to us. The
first column has the workspace IDs. In this case, we can see two workspaces called "test" 
and "kbase". We see the "chenry" is the owner of both of these workspaces, and we see the 
last modification dates of these workspace. We also see the number of objects contained in
each workspace. The "User perm" column indicates the permissions that we personally
currently have for this workspace, given our current login. Note, you can change your login
using the KBase login commands. If we change
our current login, we will see the "User perm" change. The final column indicates the default
permissions for all users of this workspace. Note, a user can be granted specific permissions
to a workspace, which overrides the defaults.</p>
<a name="STEP2"><h3>2. kbws-workspace</h3></a>
<p>Now that we can see the list of workspaces that we currently have access to, lets use
 the kbws-workspace command to select a particular workspace to work in. The usage for the
 kbws-workspace command follows:</p>
<pre><code><i>
	kbws-workspace <New workspace> [-?h] [long options...]
		-? -h --help  Print this usage information
</i></pre></code>
<p>Let's see an example of this command in action. Let's use the kbws-workspace command to
select "test" as our default workspace:</p>
<pre><code><i>
	$ kbws-workspace test
		Current workspace is:
		test
</i></pre></code>
<p>Note that this command returns output indicating the workspace we're currently logged 
into. Its easy to forget which workspace we're currently logged into. We can remind 
ourselves by running the kbws-workspace command again with no arguments:</p>
<pre><code><i>
	$ kbws-workspace
		Current workspace is:
		test
</i></pre></code>
<a name="STEP3"><h3>3. kbws-meta</h3></a>
<p></p>
<pre><code><i>
	kbws-meta [-?ehw] [long options...]
		-w --workspace     ID for workspace
		-e --showerror     Set as 1 to show any errors in execution
		-? -h --help       Print this usage information
</i></pre></code>
<p>Let's see an example of this command in action. ....</p>
<pre><code><i>
	$ kbws-meta
		Current workspace is:
		test
		localhost:KBaseClient chenry$ kbws-meta
		Workspace ID: test
		Owner: chenry
		Moddate: 2012-12-26T06:11:50
		Objects: 4
		User permission: r
		Global permission:r
		Workspace meta:
		1
</i></pre></code>

<a name="STEP4"><h3>4. kbws-listobj</h3></a>
<p></p>
<pre><code><i>
	kbws-listobj [-?ehstw] [long options...]
		-w --workspace     ID for workspace
		-t --type          Type required
		-s --showdeleted   show all objects that have been deleted
		-e --showerror     Set as 1 to show any errors in execution
		-? -h --help       Print this usage information
</i></pre></code>
