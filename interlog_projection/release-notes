OVERVIEW
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 This service provides services for getting interlog network of species A projected from the query network of species B based on ortholog information.
 The ortholog information is precomputed by Inparanoid algorithm and we plan to provide KBase Tree service based projection.
 It will serve queries for various types of network transfer from one species to the other species network. (i.e., co-expression, PPI, metabolic pathway, functional association network)
 User can exclude link pair that show low ortholog confidence using cut-off value.

VERSION: 0.0.2 (Released 01/31/2014)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NEW FEATURES:
-This is the second internal release of the Interolog Projection Service.

UPDATED FEATURES / MAJOR BUG FIXES:
-The network typed object is conform to the new api standard.


NEXT RELEASE PLAN:
We plan to include  (next major build)
  1) Tree service based orthology projection method
  2) Evidence based orthology projection method
