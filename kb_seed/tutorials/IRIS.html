<h2><br>
Introduction</h2>
<p><br>
The KBase IRIS interface allows one to run all of the<span style="font-weight: bold;"> </span>KBase command line scripts and
some useful UNIX tools from a web-based interface without downloading
any software. The interface keeps track of who you are and stores your
results and history on our KBase IRIS server. The beta version of the
IRIS interface is at <a href="/services/docs/invocation/IRIS" target="_blank">the
Interactive KBase</a>. The initial page looks like this:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <img alt="" src="/docs/cdmi/Screen%20Shot%202012-06-13%20at%202.12.36%20PM.png" style="width: 100%;"><br>
Your first action should be to log in. In this version, you can use any
login name you like, just remember it for subsequent sessions so you
can access your history and previous results. The login name must be a
single word. For instance, you can use JohnDoe, but not John Doe.&nbsp;
This is what it looks like:<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="/docs/cdmi/Screen%20Shot%202012-06-13%20at%202.14.32%20PM.png" style="width: 100%;"><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; <img alt="" src="/docs/cdmi/Screen%20Shot%202012-06-13%20at%202.13.52%20PM.png" style="width: 100%;"><br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
Notice that commands are entered in the blue window at the bottom of
the screen, and results are scrolled above it. <br>
<br>
To get started, we think of most of the KBase command-line tools as
taking in a file containing a tab-separated table and outputting a
modified table. The most common modification is the addition of one of
more columns. We create "pipelines" of these tools to implement fairly
complex transformations leading to the final table containing the
desired output. For example, consider the following little <a name="pipeline53">pipeline</a>: <br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="http://kbase.us/developer-zone/api-documentation/cdm-entity-relationship-command-scripts/#all_entities_Genome" target="_blank">all_entities_Genome</a> -f scientific_name | <a name="grep54">grep</a> "Streptococcus pneumoniae"<br>
<br>
The <a href="http://kbase.us/developer-zone/api-documentation/cdm-entity-relationship-command-scripts/#all_entities_Genome" target="_blank">all_entities_Genome</a> command is thought of as
producing a table in which the first column (by default) is the genome
ID, and any extra columns come from the arguments of the command. In
this case, we get a 2-column table:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
[genome-ID,genome-name]<br>
<br>
This 2-column table is fed into a UNIX command called <a name="grep55">grep</a>,
which keeps lines that match its argument. In this case, the <a name="grep56">grep</a> extracts rows in the table that match the
string "Streptococcus pneumoniae". Thus, we get as a result a 2-column
table in which each row contains "Streptococcus pneumoniae". During the
writing of this tutorial, the output was:<br>
<img alt="" src="/docs/cdmi/Screen%20Shot%202012-06-13%20at%202.16.06%20PM.png" style="width: 100%;"><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
Scrolling down, we see the return codes indicating success:<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="/docs/cdmi/Screen%20Shot%202012-06-13%20at%202.16.36%20PM.png" style="width: 100%;"><br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
This shows the basic notion of transforming tables, extracting rows
that contain a given string (or, more generally, a pattern), extracting
columns from a table, or sorting the rows in a table is the basic style
we advocate. For example, suppose that you wanted to find all features
of Streptococcus pneumoniae that had been assigned a specific function
(say, triosephosphate isomerase). You might try using <br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="http://kbase.us/developer-zone/api-documentation/cdm-entity-relationship-command-scripts/#all_entities_Genome" target="_blank">all_entities_Genome</a> -f scientific_name | <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<a name="grep57">grep</a> "Streptococcus
pneumoniae" | <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<a href="http://kbase.us/developer-zone/api-documentation/cdm-command-line-scripts/#genomes_to_fids" target="_blank">genomes_to_fids</a> CDS -c 1 | <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<a href="http://kbase.us/developer-zone/api-documentation/cdm-command-line-scripts/#fids_to_functions" target="_blank">fids_to_functions</a> | <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<a name="grep58">grep</a> -i "triosephosphate
isomerase"<br>
<br>
This produces output like this:<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="/docs/cdmi/Screen%20Shot%202012-06-13%20at%202.22.58%20PM.png" style="width: 100%;"><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
<br>
Here, some extra comments need to be made: <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
</p>
<ol>
  <li><a href="http://kbase.us/developer-zone/api-documentation/cdm-command-line-scripts/#genomes_to_fids" target="_blank">genomes_to_fids</a> is a KBase command that takes a
tab-separated table as input, and one of the columns in the table must
contain KBase genome IDs. By default, that column is the last column in
the table (i.e., the rightmost). If the column of genome IDs is not the
last, one uses the "-c N" argument to say that the column is the Nth.</li>
  <li><a href="http://kbase.us/developer-zone/api-documentation/cdm-command-line-scripts/#fids_to_functions" target="_blank">fids_to_functions</a> is a KBase command that takes a
table containing a column of feature ids (i.e., fids), which by default
is the last column, and extends the table with one more column, the
function assigned to the feature.</li>
  <li>Finally, the "-i" argument to <a name="grep59">grep</a> makes
the match case insensitive. <a name="grep60">grep</a> is an extremely
powerful command with a number of useful options (you can select all
rows that do not match, rows that match some specified pattern, etc.)</li>
</ol>

<h2>Additional Features of IRIS</h2>
<h3>File Storage<br>
</h3>
IRIS maintains a file system for your use. You can upload your own data
files (using the red "Upload a file"&nbsp; button in the upper right
corner of the interface), or create your own via output redirection
using the &gt; redirection symbol. Let's say you wanted to create a
file of Streptococcus genomes; you would type <br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="http://kbase.us/developer-zone/api-documentation/cdm-entity-relationship-command-scripts/#all_entities_Genome" target="_blank">all_entities_Genome</a> -f scientific_name | <a name="grep61">grep</a> "Streptococcus pneumonia"&nbsp; &gt; all_strep<br>
<br>
This creates a file with the name all_strep in your IRIS user space.
You can see your file system by using the ls command. <br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="/docs/cdmi/Screen%20Shot%202012-06-13%20at%202.23.55%20PM.png" style="width: 100%;"><br>
<br>
&nbsp; <br>
<br>
You can view individual files by clicking on them. The file will open
in a new window.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
To upload a file you have prepared on your own computer, just click on
the red "Upload a file" button in the upper right corner. Be sure to
hover over it until it turns bright red. <br>
<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="/docs/cdmi/Screen%20Shot%202012-06-13%20at%202.26.19%20PM.png" style="width: 100%;"><br>
<br style="text-decoration: underline;">
<br>
</div>
&nbsp;<br>
<br>
This will bring up a file browser you will use to select a file for
upload.<br>
Select your file and click the choose button; your file will be
uploaded into your IRIS file space for use with the KBase commands.<br>
<br>
<h2>IRIS UNIX command summary;</h2>
In IRIS, you can use the following commands which are simply run in a
UNIX shell on the server and use the full semantics of the UNIX
commands:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name="sort62">sort</a>
, <a name="grep63">grep</a>
, <a name="cut64">cut</a>
, cat, head, tail, date, echo, <a name="wc65">wc</a>
<br>
<br>
File system commands are also available, but are re-implemented on the
server as very limited version of the originals.<br>
<br>
These are: <br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; mkdir DIR<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; rmdir DIR (Removes non-empty directories without
asking)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; rm FILE<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; mv FROM TO<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cp FROM TO<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cd DIR<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ls [DIR]<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
