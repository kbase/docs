<p>The all_roles_used_in_models allows a user to access the set of roles that are included in current models.
This is important.
There are far fewer roles used in models than overall.
Hence,
the returned set represents the minimal set we need to clean up in order to properly support modeling.</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<pre>    all_roles_used_in_models [arguments] &#60; input &#62; output</pre>

<p>The standard input should be a tab-separated table (i.e., each line is a tab-separated set of fields). Normally, the last field in each line would contain the identifer. If another column contains the identifier use</p>

<pre>    -c N</pre>

<p>where N is the column (from 1) that contains the subsystem.</p>

<p>This is a pipe command. The input is taken from the standard input, and the output is to the standard output.</p>

<p>co-occurence_evidence is used to retrieve the detailed pairs of genes that go into the computation of co-occurence scores.
The scores reflect an estimate of the number of distinct OTUs that contain an instance of a co-occuring pair.
This routine returns as evidence a list of all the pairs that went into the computation.</p>

<p>The input to the computation is a list of pairs for which evidence is desired.</p>

<p>The returned output is a list of elements.
one for each input pair.
Each output element is a 2-tuple: the input pair and the evidence for the pair.
The evidence is a list of pairs of fids that are believed to correspond to the input pair.</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<pre>    co_occurrence_evidence [arguments] &#60; input &#62; output</pre>

<p>In some cases,
one wishes to know just the lengths of the contigs,

<p>The fids_to_atomic_regulons allows one to map fids into regulons that contain the fids.
Normally a fid will be in at most one regulon,

<p>Example:</p>

<p>The standard input should be a tab-separated table (i.e., each line is a tab-separated set of fields). Normally, the last field in each line would contain the identifer. If another column contains the identifier use</p>

<pre>    -c N</pre>

<p>where N is the column (from 1) that contains the subsystem.</p>

>fids_to_co_occurring_fids</a></h2>

<p>One of the most powerful clues to function relates to conserved clusters of genes on the chromosome (in prokaryotic genomes).
We have attempted to record pairs of genes that tend to occur close to one another on the chromosome.
To meaningfully do this,
we need to construct similarity-based mappings between genes in distinct genomes.
We have constructed such mappings for many (but not all) genomes maintained in the KBase CS.
The prokaryotic geneomes in the CS are grouped into OTUs by ribosomal RNA (genomes within a single OTU have SSU rRNA that is greater than 97% identical).
If two genes occur close to one another (i.e.,
corresponding genes occur close to one another),
then we assign a score,
which is the number of distinct OTUs in which such clustering is detected.
This allows one to normalize for situations in which hundreds of corresponding genes are detected,
but they all come from very closely related genomes.</p>

<p>The significance of the score relates to the number of genomes in the database.
We recommend that you take the time to look at a set of scored pairs and determine approximately what percentage appear to be actually related for a few cutoff values.</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<pre>    fids_to_co_occurring_fids [arguments] &#60; input &#62; output</pre>

<p>The standard input should be a tab-separated table (i.e., each line is a tab-separated set of fields). Normally, the last field in each line would contain the identifer. If another column contains the identifier use</p>

<pre>    -c N</pre>

<p>where N is the column (from 1) that contains the subsystem.</p>

<p>This is a pipe command. The input is taken from the standard input, and the output is to the standard output.</p>

We connect a paper to a feature when we believe that an &#34;expert&#34; has asserted that the function of the feature is basically what we have associated with the feature.
Thus,
we might attach a paper reporting the crystal structure of a protein,
even though the paper is clearly not the paper responsible for the original characterization.
Our position in this matter is somewhat controversial,
but we are seeking to characterize some assertions as relatively solid,

<p>KBase supports the creation and maintence of protein families.
Each family is intended to contain a set of isofunctional homologs.
Currently,
the families are collections of translations of features,
rather than of just protein sequences (represented by md5s,
for example).
fids_to_protein_families supports access to the features that have been grouped into a family.
Ideally,
each feature in a family would have the same assigned function.
This is not always true,

<p>fids_to_protein_sequences allows the user to look up the amino acid sequences corresponding to each of a set of fids.
You can also get the sequence from proteins (i.e.,
md5 values).
This routine saves you having to look up the md5 sequence and then accessing the protein string in a separate call.</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<pre>    fids_to_protein_sequences [arguments] &#60; input &#62; output</pre>

<p>The standard input should be a tab-separated table (i.e., each line is a tab-separated set of fields). Normally, the last field in each line would contain the identifer. If another column contains the identifier use</p>

<p>A user can invoke genomes_to_subsystems to rerieve the names of the subsystems relevant to each genome.
The input is a list of genomes.
The output is a mapping from genome to a list of 2-tuples,
where each 2-tuple give a variant code and a subsystem name.
Variant codes of -1 (or *-1) amount to assertions that the genome contains no active variant.
A variant code of 0 means &#34;work in progress&#34;,
and presence or absence of the subsystem in the genome should be undetermined.</p>

<p>protein_families_to_proteins can be used to access the set of proteins (i.e.,
the set of MD5 values) represented by each of a set of protein_families.
We define protein_families as sets of fids (rather than sets of MD5s.

<p>The routine proteins_to_functions allows users to access functions associated with specific protein sequences.
The input proteins are given as a list of MD5 values (these MD5 values each correspond to a specific protein sequence).
For each input MD5 value,
a list of [feature-id,function] pairs is constructed and returned.
Note that there are many cases in which a single protein sequence corresponds to the translation associated with multiple protein-encoding genes,
and each may have distinct functions (an undesirable situation,
we grant).</p>

<p>This function allows you to access all of the functions assigned (by all annotation groups represented in Kbase) to each of a set of sequences.</p>

<p>The routine proteins_to_literature can be used to extract the list of papers we have associated with specific protein sequences.
The user should note that in many cases the association of a paper with a protein sequence is not precise.
That is,
the paper may actually describe a closely-related protein (that may not yet even be in a sequenced genome).
Annotators attempt to use best judgement when associating literature and proteins.
Publication references include [pubmed ID,URL for the paper,
title of the paper].
In some cases,
the URL and title are omitted.
In theory,
we can extract them from PubMed and we will attempt to do so.</p>

<p>Protein families contain a set of isofunctional homologs.
proteins_to_protein_families can be used to look up is used to get the set of protein_families containing a specified protein.
For performance reasons,
you can submit a batch of proteins (i.e.,
a list of proteins),
and for each input protein,
you get back a set (possibly empty) of protein_families.
Specific collections of families (e.g.,
FIGfams) usually require that a protein be in at most one family.
However,
we will be integrating protein families from a number of sources,
and so a protein can be in multiple families.</p>

<p>The routine proteins_to_roles allows a user to gather the set of functional roles that are associated with specifc protein sequences.
A single protein sequence (designated by an MD5 value) may have numerous associated functions,
since functions are treated as an attribute of the feature,
and multiple features may have precisely the same translation.
In our experience,
it is not uncommon,
even for the best annotation teams,
to assign distinct functions (and,
hence,
functional roles) to identical protein sequences.</p>

<p>For each input MD5 value,
this routine gathers the set of features (fids) that share the same sequence,
collects the associated functions,
expands these into functional roles (for multi-functional proteins),
and returns the set of roles that results.</p>

<p>Note that,
if the user wishes to see the specific features that have the assigned fiunctional roles,
they should use proteins_to_functions instead (it returns the fids associated with each assigned function).</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<pre>    proteins_to_roles [arguments] &#60; input &#62; output</pre>

<p>The standard input should be a tab-separated table (i.e., each line is a tab-separated set of fields). Normally, the last field in each line would contain the identifer. If another column contains the identifier use</p>

<p>roles_to_complexes allows a user to connect Roles to Complexes,
from there,
the connection exists to Reactions (although in the actual ER-model model,
the connection from Complex to Reaction goes through ReactionComplex).
Since Roles also connect to fids,
the connection between fids and Reactions is induced.</p>

<pre>                F1 / F2  (where F1 and F2 are roles)  is a function that implements
                          two functional roles in different domains of the protein.
                F1 @ F2 implements multiple roles through broad specificity
                F1; F2  is thought to implement F1 or f2 (uncertainty)

            You often wish to find the fids in one or more genomes that
            implement specific functional roles.  To do this, you can use

The &#34;row&#34; is itself a 2-tuple composed of the variant code,

We suggest writing a simple test script to get,
say,
the subsystem named &#39;Histidine Degradation&#39;,
extracting the spreadsheet,

The parameter &#34;input&#34; is the text string to be searched for.
The parameter &#34;entities&#34; defines the entities to be searched.
If the list is empty,
all indexed entities will be searched.
The &#34;start&#34; and &#34;count&#34; parameters limit the results to &#34;count&#34; hits starting at &#34;start&#34;.</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<pre>    text_search [arguments] &#60; input &#62; output</pre>

<p>The standard input should be a tab-separated table (i.e., each line is a tab-separated set of fields). Normally, the last field in each line would contain the identifer. If another column contains the identifier use</p>

<pre>    -c N</pre>

<p>where N is the column (from 1) that contains the subsystem.</p>

<p>This is a pipe command. The input is taken from the standard input, and the output is to the standard output.</p>

<p>This script is a wrapper for the CDMI-API call text_search. It is documented as follows:</p>

<pre>  $return = $obj-&#62;text_search($fids)</pre>

<dl>
<dt><a name="Parameter_and_return_types"
>Parameter and return types</a></dt>

<dd>
<pre>
$fids is a fids
$return is a reference to a hash where the key is a fid and the value is an annotations
fids is a reference to a list where each element is a fid
fid is a string
annotations is a reference to a list where each element is an annotation
annotation is a reference to a list containing 3 items:
	0: a comment
	1: an annotator
	2: an annotation_time
comment is a string
annotator is a string
annotation_time is an int
